I told my friends and family that I'd had an eye infection and the patch was needed to help with the recovery, but they'll have to work out soon enough that this was a lie. I can't wear it forever. <nl> Luckily, I live alone so it hasn't been too hard to hide most of the time. Eventually, though, I'll have to take it off. <nl> The first time I discovered this ""gift"" (after all, that's how people would probably describe it) I was physically sick. I can't even tell you why it started, only when. <nl> It happened while I stood in the queue at my local supermarket. A little old lady was being served and chatted happily to the cashier. Suddenly, I had an itch in my right eye and, as I closed it and rubbed it, I saw through my left eye a...vision...of that same sweet lady at home mercilessly beating her disabled husband. Vision may not be the right word, I felt her husband's pain both physical and mental. Not just the pain of that beating, the pain of everything she had inflicted on him for what was almost certainly many years. <nl>Time to face the music, I suppose.<nl><nl> I threw up on the spot and started to feel faint. The next thing I remember I was lying on the floor surrounded by concerned looking people. Apparently I had gone down pretty hard and banged the side of my face. The manager of the supermarket was holding a bag of frozen peas over my now swollen left eye. The old lady from the queue had given me a tissue to wipe the vomit from my face. Looking at her now, I felt a radiating love from within. I felt the joy of her grandchildren as she baked for them, and the reassurance that her pet terrier (whose name I somehow knew was Bella) felt every time this lady returned home. <nl> Looking around, I was surrounded by similar feelings from all those who had stopped to help. It was honestly overwhelming. I had no idea what was happening, I assumed I was having some sort of episode. Surely that would also explain the horrific thing I had seen before blacking out. <nl> I rose to my feet and thanked everybody for being so concerned. I did my best to try to convince them I was fine. I certainly didn't want to go to the hospital, not after what happened last time. <nl> I removed the bag of peas from my face and tried to open my left eye. Though I was only able to open it a tiny bit and felt severe pain. Not in my eye, in my...everything. <nl> I saw, and felt, once again the pain that this lady's husband lived and, looking around, I felt so much more. People who had been cheated on, people who had been lied to and belittled, and a young girl, maybe 19 years old called Lucy, who had taken her own life after being raped by the well-dressed man stood just my right. <nl> I know I got out of there as quickly as I can but, I'll be honest, the next few days are a bit of a blur. All I can say for sure is that it didn't go away, and still hasn't. <nl> The swelling on my eye was bad enough that I wasn't able to open it for a while without serious effort. This gave me time to buy a gauze patch and some medical tape without needing to see anything that I didn't want to. By the time it healed, I had been wearing the patch non-stop...but, like I said, I'll have to take it off eventually. <nl> I'm terrified of what I'll see next. I've been avoiding my friends and family as much as I can because I don't want to know what they're hiding. How do I live knowing, feeling, truly understanding the pain that they've inflicted on others? <nl> The thing that scares me the most, though, is that eventually I'll have to look at myself. <nl> --- <nl> I'm clearly no writer, I've just always fancied having a bit of a bash and this prompt seemed quite a fun place to do it. I hope you enjoyed it, though I won't be hurt if you didn't. I fully admit that I had a basic idea of what I wanted to do but don't have the talent to properly flesh it out or word it all correctly. I had fun writing it though, so thanks OP. <eos>

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> The plan was madness. Sheer, utter, madness. <nl> But they were out of options. <nl> Iraka shuddered as the metal spikes connected to his palps and chelicerae, easily punching through the delicate cuticles to the flesh beneath. It wasn't an elegant solution, but it would allow movement of his mouthpieces to be translated into commands. <nl> He only had eight limbs, after all. Even with each of his arms wired for motion, it wasn't enough to manage all the fine control needed. The engineers had, therefore, gotten creative with the interface, finding other ways of translating body motion into the alien equivalents. <nl> There was a direct neural interface as well, of course. The connection points were attached to his cephalothorax. The weight of the neural rig would have been uncomfortable, if he wasn't completely suspended and buoyant in some kind of cushioning gel. But the neural systems were relatively untested and extremely unpredictable. <nl> Brain-computer interfaces weren't popular among the people. There were moral issues that centums of development had still not adequately solved. Iraka knew that with his biology wired into the machinery, like this, there would be no going back. <nl> But as the great eggbearer had once said - for the desperate, all was permissible. <nl>He had never seen the homeworld. Neither had his eggbearer, or her eggbearer before her. They were descendants, now, the nymphs and larvae of the original task force. They'd lost contact with the rest of the people early on. Mere decicentums after landing, both the central command vessel and the auxiliaries had been lost, and along with them, all of the fleet's superluminal pulse generators. <nl> But despite the dire situation, Iraka continued to hope for a better future.<nl><nl> There were other tubes and connections, too, conduits hooked up to his spiracles, feeding him with a special oxygenated mix instead of regular air... and many other lines running into his body, making him feel like a larvae's antiprism. <nl> The life support systems were necessary, because his body had been heavily modified to the limits of the people's science. So heavily modified, in truth, that he could no longer survive outside the artificial environment of his pod. <nl> Yet, in exchange, he was effectively immortal. Or undying, at least, so long as all the technology remained functional. He could still perish in combat, but the pod was designed to keep him alive far longer than any member of the people should reasonably expect to live. <nl> But that too was necessary, for this was a war unlike any the people had fought. <nl> Iraka had never seen the homeworld. Neither had his eggbearer, or her eggbearer before her. They were descendants, now, the nymphs and larvae of the original task force. They'd lost contact with the rest of the people early on. Mere decicentums after landing, both the central command vessel and the auxiliaries had been lost, and along with them, all of the fleet's superluminal pulse generators. <nl> As far as they knew, they were on their own. <nl> Contrary to the intelligence reports, the world they'd arrived on was not an uninhabited planet, ripe for colonisation. No, it was a world of monsters, its biosphere comprised of hostile megafauna unlike anything the people had ever catalogued. <nl> This was a war unlike anything in recorded history, because they were not fighting for conquest, but mere survival. <nl> By now, their resources were dwindling. Iraka had been one of the circle of eight that had conceived of this final, desperate, plan. He knew it was foolish, but what else was there? They didn't have the industrial capacity to fight back in any other meaningful way. <nl> No, the only thing left was to use this excreting-nephridium world's ecology against it. Turning it against itself... or, if all went well, harnessing it for the people's survival. <nl> ""This is Iraka,"" he said, vocalising his thoughts. ""Readiness check."" <nl> ""This is command,"" came the distant reply. ""Connectivity is strong. Synchronisation is ready. We are able to act."" <nl> ""Action,"" Iraka ordered. <nl> At once, he felt the systems seize control, flooding his brain with strange, nearly incomprehensible sensations. The interior of the pod seemed to melt away, as his senses were gradually replaced by those of another. <nl> It was sheer luck that, despite the alienness of the local megafauna's biology, they still had identifiable brains and nerves that functioned via electrical impulses. The magnitude of the creatures was, of course, beyond anything surveyed. But they were, in the end, comprehensible. <nl> Iraka opened his eyes. Not his five eyes, located laterally on his body, but a mere two eyes - although each was vast, the size of a vessel of the fleet. He moved his two new forelimbs, flexing both the limbs themselves, then each of the five sub-limbs located at the end of the appendages. <nl> He knew the movements were ponderous by the normal timescale of the people, but the interface was altering his own perception of time to match that of the native species. <nl> It had worked. <nl> There was hope. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> *** <nl> EDIT: Changed the word 'macrofauna' to 'megafauna', as noted by /u/waka324 <eos>

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> Ian always hated English class. It was rare for there to be anything that interested him. Most of the books were boring and the writing assignments were even more so. A four page essay about my spring break? I stayed at home watching TV and playing StarCraft, should I write about that? Uhg. <nl> While Ian internally complained and stared out the window, Mr. Smith was droning on about something. Ian didn't care, probably something dumb. He would ask Chris about it later. <nl> ""... count on you, right Ian?"" Mr. Smith said. <nl> Ian focused his attention towards him. Mr. Smith had his hands on the shoulders of a kid wearing a collared shirt and jeans. It also had a lizard face. Weird. Wait. <nl> ""Excuse me, what the fuck,"" Ian said aloud as what he was seeing finally hit him. <nl> ""Ian, watch your language! Are you going to help Mark get settled in or not? If you do I may forget the fact you just cursed in my classroom."" <nl> Ian was still trying to wrap his head around this. He looked around the room and no one seemed to care. Some of his classmates were doodling, others casually looking in his direction. 'Mark' was looking right at him. Okay, I wanted to end my boredom but this is too damn much, he thought to himself. Think. No one else is responding to this, maybe it's a prank or... maybe you are hallucinating. Okay, I'll show him around, first top, nurses office. <nl> ""I guess,"" Ian said still filled with doubt and worry. <nl> ""Great. Chris, can you please make sure to give him a copy of your notes after class?"" <nl> ""Sure thing, Mr. Smith,"" Chris replied. <nl> ""Alright, Ian get going. Come back when you are done."" <nl> ""Okay,"" Ian said while staring hard at Mark. <nl>Yep, there he goes,"" 'Mark' said as Ian lost consciousness. <nl> Ian woke up to the sound of his alarm going off. He sat up in bed, rubbing his eyes and trying to shake off the strange dream he had just experienced. <nl> 12#In the nurse's office, Mrs. Brooks took his temperature and it read 98, a bit low, but nothing to worry about. Why don't you go back to class for now, if you start to feel worse you can come back.<nl><nl> Ian got out of his desk and grabbed his bag. There was a part of him that wanted to look up and see some normal pimply face teenager staring back at him when he looked up again. <nl> No luck. Still a guy with a green head that resembled a Komodo dragon. <nl> Ian opened the door and held it for Mark who exited the classroom. <nl> Think, Ian, how do I figure this out. Shit. Wait. <nl> ""So, where are you from?"" Ian asked without looking at him. <nl> ""You probably have never heard of it, it's pretty far away."" He replied, his voice was raspy with a bit of lisp, but it was distinctly a North American English accent of some sort. Ian was never good at that stuff. Like he could tell if someone was from the south or the east coast but that's about it. <nl> ""I see. Well, let's go to the nurse first I have to ask her a question, but here are the 2nd floor classrooms as you have already figured out. Any classroom with a 2... which now that I'm saying it, that's probably obvious."" <nl> ""A little,"" Mark said with an odd chortle. ""Are you okay?"" <nl> Fuck. The one question he didn't want this guy to ask. No, there are a million questions he didn't want him to ask. Keep it simple until you figure this out Ian. <nl> ""Yeah, might be getting a cold or something."" Ian replied. <nl> They descended the stairs to the first floor near the entry to the building. <nl> ""Okay so down that way,"" Ian pointed behind the stairs, ""are the A lockers and classrooms, mostly for freshman. And over that way, are the C lockers and the C classrooms and this way are B."" Ian said this as he pointed down the halls where they were. <nl> ""Got it."" <nl> ""And around this corner are all the administration crap, principal's office, nurse's office, all that shit. So give me a minute. I'll be back in a few."" Ian said as he opened the door to the nurses office. <nl> Mrs. Brooks was sitting at her computer as he entered. She looked up, smiled and slid her chair into the open. <nl> ""Hello, young man. Ian, right?"" <nl> ""Yes, ma'am."" <nl> ""What's wrong?"" <nl> ""I don't really know, I think I might have a fever or something. I was seeing weird stuff earlier."" <nl> Please don't ask me. Please don't ask me. <nl> ""That doesn't sound good. Let's take your temperature, though I must say you look perfectly fine."" <nl> ""Yeah, it just happened a bit ago. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't weird."" <nl> She gave him a concerned, but puzzled look before handing him a thermometer. He put it in his mouth. Ian knew there was nothing wrong. Mark was a damned lizard person and he was the only one that could see it. This was some serious horror stuff going on. Lovecraft, King... something. <nl> A moment later the thermometer beeped. Mrs. Brooks took it. <nl> ""98, a bit low, but nothing to worry about. Why don't you go back to class for now, if you start to feel worse you can come back."" <nl> Figures. <nl> ""Okay, thanks Mrs. Brooks."" <nl> Ian left the office to see Mark sitting on a nearby chair in the hall. <nl> ""Everything okay?"" He asked. <nl> No, it's not, you still look like a damned lizard. <nl> ""No. You are going to think this is nuts... but right now you look like a lizard person. I don't mean I think you are ugly or weird or something... like LITERALLY A LIZARD PERSON. I think I'm losing my mind."" <nl> Mark chuckled. <nl> ""Well, guess someone is losing their fucking job. Flarxal, did you hear that?.. No, I didn't authorize that yet... This was a long term mission, estimated ten earth years... No, EARTH YEARS... You what?.. For the love of... Well, sorry Ian. You weren't suppose to find out this way."" Mark lifted his wrist and a holographic interface appeared. He did something to it and his face shifted to that of an almost generic high school student. Dark hair, roman nose, pimples all that. Then it reverted back. <nl> Ian was trying to wrap his head around this. What the actual fuck. He started to feel light headed. He fell backwards. <nl> ""Yep, there he goes,"" 'Mark' said as Ian lost consciousness. <nl> *Continued below.* <eos>

I looked at the field disdainfully. <nl> ""Seriously Maize? This is like the one time your power is totally on point!"" My glare hardened at her as I shifted back to normal.

I muttered sarcastically, ignoring the next wave of whispers and stares that followed my change. <nl> I'd long since gotten over my misfortune of power. Figures that an electromagnetic surge would hit the one time I was playing a kids game, granting me and several other thousand people the ""gifts"" of our game characters. <nl> Do you know how wicked some of these people's power's were? Most of them were changing the weather to avoid natural disasters, telekinetically rescuing people from fires, leaping tall buildings in a single bound. . .you know, superhero shit. <nl> Now in all fairness, I was hiding a secret. I hadn't just been playing a kid's game that auspicious Friday, I'd been modding and redeveloping it. Including my player. <nl>As I sat down at my computer desk, I noticed that the cursor was blinking on the unfinished code I had left running.<nl><nl> In fact when the surge hit, I'd been typing code in specifically to mod my player. You'd think that'd left me with a glitch or two, but nope, it left me with an unfinished code and a blinking cursor. <nl> When faced with the actual reality of becoming all-powerful, one tends to freeze up a little. Sure, I could code the crap out of myself and run this world from here until probably the end of time.....but was it ethical? Moral? And the question that bothered me most, what then? <nl> I'd had a couple of months to have an existential crisis and hadn't been able to get past what happens next. The other players had showed me what a little power could do to a person. On the news you heard the amazing stories of the ""PC Heroes"" and how our world needed something extraordinary to survive. The chat rooms told a different story. <nl> Forums had popped up all over of PCs struggling with controlling their abilities, getting addicted, depressed, and some suicidal. After reading a post from a 15-year old my fantasies fell cold in their tracks, ""I feel numb, like humming electric wire I have one purpose and it is my power. When I use it I lose myself and when I don't I think of nothing else. I've lost my love, my pain, my anger. I've lost. I'm lost."" That was the last post she made. Two months ago. <nl> But was it selfish to not do it? Was it worth losing myself if I could save the lives of others? The thought had me frozen in indecision for months. <nl> ""Mai,"" my friend shook me, ""Game's over, let's blow this popsicle stand."" She gestured towards the line shuffling towards the exit. <nl> Everything started happening in slow motion as the ground began shaking, and a crack in the stadium opened up below Raya. <nl> Screams rang out from every direction, but Raya's sounded right in my ear as I reached out to grab her. ""Raya!"" I cried out, grasping her forearm in mine as she dropped into the hole. <nl> ""Don't let go, don't let go, Mai, please, I love you, don't let go"" Raya sobbed over and over, fingers digging into my arm. The ground still shook beneath me, crack deepening, I reached another hand down holding her tightly. <nl> Tears streamed from my eyes as I struggled to hold her, I had to pull her up. ""Help! Help! We need help!"" I yelled looking around for anyone. There were others helping pull up victims who had fallen also, people still running for the exits screaming, chaos. <nl> ""I've got you! Hold on!"" A man ran over to my left and laid a hand on my shoulder has he reached down to grab Raya. ""Pull!"" He yelled. I strained my burning muscles as far as they could go, we grunted as we pulled her backward, sliding out of the crack and falling back into the stadium seats. <nl> ""We've got to go,"" I shouted grabbing Raya, still heaving on the ground. <nl> The man nodded and stumbled with us through the crowd to the exit. The shaking had ceased but we still moved quickly to the main level, getting as far as possible from the near death Raya had nearly faced an the real death for many others. <nl> As we reached the parking lot and the leave that awaiting I pulled away from Raya, already nearly jogging back towards the stadium. ""Go home,"" I said to her, ""There's something I need to do."" <nl> I had some coding to do. <eos>

And it certainly wasn't his intelligence, his beard frequently got caught in his toaster. No, what made Grorric dangerous is that he saw through elven bullshit with near clairvoyant ability. What the other elves at his firm might see as a truly genuine promise from a rival firm, Grorric would see for what it is; 'Elven Fuckery,' as he usually called it. As mentioned, subtlety was not Grorric's strong suit, so him identifying this fuckery was invariably followed by the whole meter of him jumping on the table and crying bullshit. <nl> If he wasn't the most effective trader on the market, this behavior almost certainly would have gotten him fired. <nl> In his time on the markets, Grorric had gone head to head with some of the biggest hedge funds and traders out there. The Spectre of Stocks, the only Drow in a leadership position on Wall Street, didn't stand a chance. The Chief, a High Elf from a small village somewhere in Cobblewood, retired 3 weeks after Grorric turned his hedge fund belly up. And the High Priest of Prices herself, Sarya Sarwarin of Winterhelm, ended up joining Grorric's firm. <nl> But beyond being able to see through elven lies and deceit, Grorric's greatest strength was that he knew better than to buy into his own hype. After all, he didn't particularly care for finance, so all the names meant very little to him. He also barely even knew what he was doing, most of the words he heard meant nothing to him. He knew a few simple rules: <nl> 1. Call out bullshit, fuck these elves <nl> 2. Buy low, sell high <nl> 3. Prices more or less go up depending on how a company performs <nl> 4. You could manipulate those prices by buying a lot of one stock at once <nl> He generally used that last rule to screw over hedge funds. Most hedges knew he could screw them if he wanted, but they had no idea how. And today, the biggest hedge fund of them all wanted to talk to him. And he had plans to fuck over the richest of the rich elves. <nl> So you can imagine his surprise when a human walked into the conference room, flanked by elves, just as he was (most of whom Grorric had screwed in the past). <nl> ""Hello,"" the human opened. ""My name's Tim, you must be Grorric."" <nl> After a moment, Grorric snapped out of his shock. ""Aye, last time I checked. I'm not used to seeing humans in this business."" <nl> Tim laughed. ""Yeah, I'm kinda new. Turns out an industry generally reserved for elves doesn't know how to handle a human, gives me a leg up."" He looked into Grorric's eyes and the sweetest smile crawled across his lips. ""As a dwarf in finance, I'm sure you get it."" <nl> Grorric sat, frozen to his seat for a moment, then stood up (which actually made him much shorter than when he had been on his chair). ""'Scuse us for a second, lads, we'll be right back."" Grorric grabbed Sarya's wrist and dragged her from the room. <nl> ""I cannae do this,"" he said as soon as they were somewhere private. <nl> ""What?"" she almost yelled, and Grorric urged her to be quiet. ""Why?"" <nl><nl> However, what Grorric didn't realize was that Tim was not actually a human, but a very skilled shape-shifter who had taken on the appearance of a human to gain an advantage in the finance world. Grorric's inability to get a read on him would prove to be his downfall.<nl><nl> ""I'm useful with elves,"" he explained. ""I can see through yer fuckery, that's a *human*. I haven't ever even talked to a human, I can't get a read on the fucker to save my life."" <nl> Srya's face dropped. ""Think that's why they brought him?"" <nl> Grorric shrugged. ""Maybe, I sure as shit don't know. All I know is sitting across that table are representatives of some of the richest rich fucks on the continent. And I just so happened to have screwed over pretty much everyone at that table at some point or another, except Tim, because I have no clue what he's thinking."" <nl> ""So what do we do?"" <nl> ""Find out what stocks they're hedging on and see if we can't short them,"" Grorric replied. ""See what we can find out. But it means we'll all have to try equally, every member of the team."" <nl> Sarya was silent for a moment. ""So we're fucked?"" <nl> Grorric nodded. ""Oh yah."" <nl> When they walked back into the conference room, every face across the table had the biggest smile on their faces, except Tim, who just looked confused. ""Oh, good, you're back,"" he said. ""Shall we begin then?"" <eos>

I'll do it."" <nl> ""Alright."" His eyes rolled back and he began to chant something unintelligible. I could see blood coming out of his nose as his chanting got louder and the ground began to shake. This continued for about twenty more seconds before a small portal opened behind him. After the portal opened, he immediately stopped. <nl> ""The knowledge has been imbued within you. Now just give me a few minutes to talk to Lena."" He walked through the portal, closing it as he left. Soon after, Marie came running down the stairs. <nl> ""Mom, what the hell was that?

I said, picking up my books that fell. <nl> ""I don't know precisely. She's always been talking about visiting the human world, she's never been, always interested in the human race, always on her phone, reading about it."" He chuckled a bit, placing his hand on Lena's shoulder. <nl> ""Dad! You're embarrassing me!"" She shouted, taking his hand off her shoulder. ""You can go dad."" <nl> Satan turned to me and whispered,"" I'll come back for her when you meet Scott."" <nl> ""Scott? Who's-"" <nl> ""Alright, I gotta go! Gotta damn some tortured souls!

Maybe it was shock from seeing Satan. <nl> ""So, Lena, I know this isn't the right question to ask, but do you, like your father, have those crazy powers?"" I asked. <nl> ""Yup! I don't use them though, no need to."" <nl> ""Alright. Well, food's in the fridge, and since it's summer vacation, Marie and I can show you around the city, and until I meet whoever Scott is, you'll have to go school.""

But luckily, me and Marie were able to help her. Mainly Marie, they were always close.

A table, to be sure, but stainless steel and sterile.  Well, the man's in a chair, too, but that should go without saying. <nl>Certainly, but please do remember that we have no responsibility for any damages to your own person,"" the abductor replies, with a sly grin. <nl> 14<nl><nl> The man is confused, as most men are.  He's got a bit of a jowl situation going on, and if you look at him from this light, which is pointed directly into his face, he looks remarkably like a beige frog. <nl> Still air, recycled air, dry air, causes the man to cough.  Moving his neck side to side, he tries to remove some of the strain, but his eyelids seem to be weighted, and he struggles to stay awake. <nl> As if on cue, which it is, a door whooshes open behind him, the fancy kind that reads your biological makeup and decides it's very important for you to enter this room, right here, right now.  Very expensive.  Very flashy.  Good for impressing any potential clients. <nl> Anyway, the intruder makes his way into the room, and pulls a chair up in front of the other.  The frog-looking man blinks in confusion, the drugs still working their way out of his system. <nl> ""Where am I?""  he asks. <nl> Sensible question. <nl> ""You've been abducted,"" his abductor says, quite cheerfully. <nl> Sensible answer. <nl> The abducted man tries to stand, but realizes he's being restrained in this chair.  Arms, legs, torso, even his feet stick to the floor as if powerful magnets have been inserted into the soles of his shoes. <nl> Which they have been. <nl> ""What am I doing here?"" <nl> Another sensible question.  No time to spend debating as to why this man's been abducted, which most people tend to do. <nl> ""To be frank, Mr. Salvador, you're up here for legal reasons."" <nl> The restrained man eyes his captor.  An extraordinarily handsome gentlemen.  Two arms.  Two legs.  Two eyes.  Nothing particularly out of the ordinary. <nl> He presses a button beneath the table, and the wall behind him transforms into a window. <nl> Mr. Salvador finds himself quite distressed.  Not only has he been abducted, but he's trapped somewhere in space, orbiting over Earth. <nl> ""Am I in some kind of space station?"" <nl> ""A space ship, if you're looking for easy classification.  We just need you to sign here, Mr. Salvador."" <nl> A piece of paper materializes on the table, and to Mr. Salvador's surprise, a long contract headlined by the Disney corporation logo appears at the top. <nl> ""Your planet runs our third most popular Milky Way reality show, Mr. Salvador, but frankly, our ratings have been tanking.  Not only that, but you're expensive to maintain.  The galactic blackout around your planet to prevent any kind of external contact isn't cheap."" <nl> The man in the suit watches Mr. Salvador, his voice pumped full of the kind of cheery optimism to chirp up anyone on a cloudy day. <nl> ""But we'd planned on cancelling about seven years ago, but frankly the whole 'continental shift' that was supposed to wipe out all human life didn't particularly go as planned.   So we're here for plan B."" <nl> Mr. Salvador's mouth opens slightly, perfecting the imitation of a frog. <nl> ""But you're a human?"" he asks. <nl> He'd always imagined aliens would be of the tentacled or insect variety, but this was a man.  Indistinguishable.  Not even those forehead ridges you'll see on campy sci-fi shows from the seventies and eighties.  Not something identical. <nl> ""Most people are,"" his captor responds. <nl> ""So you're an alien?"" <nl> ""Alien's a relative term, Mr. Salvador.  I'm here so you understand your part here, and we just need you to sign."" <nl> Mr. Salvador blinks once.  Twice.  Thrice. <nl> ""Are there people out there?  Are we alone in the universe?"" <nl> The questions came unbidden, and seemed standard to the situation.  Neither the abductor nor the abuctee really cared too much about the answers, but this was the time and place to get them out of the way. <nl> ""Yes to both, but your planet in particular isn't anything special.  A grafted world to mimic our own, but when it comes down to it, we're here for entertainment."" <nl> He taps the paper. <nl> ""Sign."" <nl> ""What if I don't?  You haven't told me why I'm here."" <nl> The man in the suit gives a disapproving tut, and gestures out the window. <nl> ""While we'd never force anyone, it'd be quite the shame if you were to be accidentally ejected from an airlock.People are cheap, Mr. Salvador, and we're only here to provide you an exciting business opportunity.  A way to be a pioneer for life on Earth.  The reason's as good as any other."" <nl> Mr. Salvador wants to believe what the suit is telling him, as most people do, when they're restrained to chairs and fairly aware of the imminent threat of violence.  Still, he hesitates. <nl> ""Is there something you're not telling me?  Why do you need me to sign it anyway?  You already brought me onto the ship."" <nl> The question feels ridiculous, but he can barely think straight.  Something out a bizarre fevered dream. <nl> ""Plenty,"" the abductor says.  ""But we respect the autonomy and value of human life, and would like to get your approval before we move forward with this project.  Call it moral and bureaucratic approval."" <nl> The man in the chair nods in a kind of detached agreement, and his chins give a slight shake.  There's nothing particularly impressive about him, traveling around and making sure paper work is correct wherever he goes. <nl> Mr. Salvador can lift his arm, and proceeds to sign.  He doesn't really see much reason not to, and he doesn't think he'd get a lawyer if he asked. <nl> ""Why the Disney logo?"" he asks. <nl> ""Well, Disney is everywhere.  They pop up on every human world in one form or another.  Different names, different logos.  Usually."" <nl> He rolls up the sheet, and stands, tucking it into an immaculate suit. <nl> A smile.  Wide and predatory. <nl> A needle pops out from the ceiling, injecting Mr. Salvador with - something. <nl> ""From now on, you'll be known as patient zero, Mr. Salvador, and released back into captivity after a memory wipe."" <nl> Mr. Salvador begins to sweat. <nl> ""What did you inject me with?"" <nl> The man in the suit shrugs. <nl> ""Hopefully something of the entertaining sort.  Like if ebola and smallpox had a baby, and that baby decided to have an exceptionally infectious disease."" <nl> Before Mr. Salvador can raise a protest, another needle pricks him with something else, the kind of thick viscous liquid that pumps through your veins and sends you off to dreamland. <nl> The next solar cycle, on the third rock from the sun, in a particular solar system populated mostly by naked apes, a man gets into his car before going on a business trip. <nl> He looks at himself in the mirror.  Quite like a frog. <nl> One cough.  Two. <nl> He puts a tissue to his lips, but balls it up, tossing it to the passenger seat. <nl> If he'd looked closely, he'd see it speckled with blood. <nl> Carrying a pathogen. <nl> He arrives at the airport, infecting nearly three dozen people at the TSA.  On the plane, he can't seem to stop sneezing, gets up, goes into the lavatory, and hocks an exceptionally large and ominously colored glob of snot.  Two days later, he lays on a hotel bed, sweat soaking into the sheets and nearly delirious from fever. <nl> In his confusion, he thinks he remembers a room and a man, somewhere far above the sky, whirling through the dark with more stars than he'd ever known. <nl> He dies alone.  As most people do. <nl> The man in the ship watches with analytical interest, completely detached as to the reality of the situation below, and begins to plot out how the pathogen will spread. <nl> Cameras everywhere in the atmosphere, satellites linked to a comprehensive network, capable of portraying almost every human's struggle to an audience in the trillions. <nl> *This'll be good,* he thinks.  *Violent.  Savage.  Give it a few weeks, and their meticulously built global structures should fall.  Mass chaos, mass looting, hopefully a few conventional wars.  Something to really shake up the status quo, get some quality plot twists going on their whole direction as a species.* <nl> Few things can really shake up a world order like a seemingly unstoppable disease, mutated out several meticulously selected strains, brought and tested by bio-engineers.  Last time they'd gotten a significant boost by starting a pair of world wars, but these days things were too interconnected.  A disease would turn that right on its head, use it against them. <nl> He hopes it'll raise the ratings, but if nothing else, they'll just launch the rock into the sun if the thing turns into a bust and collect the insurance money. <nl> As long as they remain in the black, it doesn't matter how the money is made.  Hell, a staged 'Alien Invasion' may work if the population recovers fast enough.  That'd be some quality drama. <nl> In his office, the man in the suit, who is still a man but not from Earth, watches the blue ball with disinterest. <nl> So it goes. <nl> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <nl> r/storiesfromapotato - for stuff from me <nl> r/redditserials - for longer stuff from me and others <eos>

His mouth yawned sumptiously. Two large, felt eyelids withdrew from his eyes. The big, black irises in their centers meant that he didn't have to *put on* puppy eyes to get what he wanted. Rather, he wore them naturally. This fact had brought him not only the affection of the humans, but also a comfortable shelter and as much food as he desired. Fluffmaster 3000 rolled over onto his fluffy paws. He was pink, squat, and about the size of a watermelon. A hind leg lifted itself off the ground and attempted to scratch its owner behind the ear. This attempt had to be aborted, however, because neither could the aforementioned extremity overcome the roundness of his belly, nor was his momentary three-leggedness doing any favors to his stability. The hind leg returned to the ground. Just in time, too, for Fluffmaster 3000 came dangerously close to toppling into the white rug's soft embrace. Quite an adventure. <nl> ""Ooh, look who's woken up!"" a doting voice said. ""Who's a good boy!"" it continued. The voice belonged to Vanessa Dimbright, or ""V"" as she liked to be called. On earth, she had been a social worker. Fed up with the low pay and little respect in broader society, she re-trained as a navigator and signed up for a mission to deep space. Now, she was still being paid a pittance and received just as little respect, but at least she had found a pet. <nl> V picked up Fluffmaster 3000 into her soft, gentle hands, and cradled all 15 lbs. of alien fat in her arms. <nl> Hard to believe that the creature was a member of a race of warmongering aliens that had ravaged the galaxy in search for -- well, frankly, they didn't really know. Turns out, they were all just very unhappy and decided to act out their unhappiness by looting and pillaging worlds across the Milky Way. This went on for aeons until, unbeknownst to them, an expedition of humans gave these murderous, fluffy delights precisely what they had wanted all along: a soft pillow to sleep on, three square meals a day, and enough cuddles to soften even Josef Stalin's stony heart. <nl>The makeshift electricity generator had been cobbled together with bits of wire and a half-empty energy cell. It hummed contentedly in the corner, supplying power to the consoles and lights. Suddenly, a loud beep signaled that the power was failing and the lights flickered ominously.<nl><nl> Fluffmaster 3000 snuffled into Vanessa's bosoms. <eos>

For all the miles they could see, they see nothing but an endless world. This should please them, you would think. But there is something coursing through the air, a wind rising in the heavens above.

In our towers in the Far World, we see the specks roam, little mites mustering the courage to leave their bunkers. See how the light hits them. See their flag fly high in the open lands. <nl> *America,* I think. <nl> Long ago, my family was American. I feel some sadness to them. The gates to heaven have closed. Our world is leaving, and our goodbyes nearly spent. But see them come. See the war torn land all brown and turned, stony and wild. Look at them look for us. See the mites fall in confusion. <nl> And if you hear my words and sense some bitterness in them, then I shan't pretend to hide it. The War had taken much from me. All that I loved is gone. But such is war. And such was the American war. <nl> And if you hear my words and my words echo in the stillness of the deserted lands, then let me explain. For you are unlucky, perhaps even a child, born innocent, condemned to die. For that you deserve some solace. Solace is all I can give. <nl> When the War had ended, half the world had died. Their screams and chemical shadows haunted the peace, and what talks were held were facetious. We knew this world was gone. What good was dismantling bombs when the knowledge would forever remain? We had to leave. The Sun was growing warmer, the days going quicker in the silence of burying the dead. <nl> We had to leave. <nl> After the War ended what countries remained made a very hard decision. We banded together after Lucifer's Week. That was the week where a new bomb fell every day. We decided everything had to end. For humanity to survive, we would have to leave our human home. This we agreed with heavy hearts. <nl> And we gritted our teeth and negotiated with the Americans. If you are reading this amidst the lonely plains, then know we negotiated with your fathers. We gave them everything they wanted, placated their fancies, and pleaded and begged in all the right ways for just one  favor: for us all to isolate ourselves for fifty years. <nl> The Americans thought they had won. You all could never accept the idea of loss, or even *compromise*. And so they agreed. They thought in the dark, with all the world fragmented, they would grow even more powerful. And perhaps they have. <nl> But we had deceived them. In those fifty years they had caged themselves, and we worked freely on creating vast ships to take us off this failing planet. <nl> Cancers are on the rise. Most lands are dead, barren like so many women who were cowed in the final bunkers. Most lands are dead, same as those women. Same as my only love. <nl> And we have built great towers in what pockets of life that still remain. Great spires to the heavens house our ever readying ships. And now as the nights come cold and the frost heavy with the ghosts of the dead, and the heavy feeling of time running out, we have completed those ships. We ready ourselves for the journey come. Just as You have awakened. <nl> So now see the American stretch. See how the land sprawls in a lonely plateau.  Hear the silence and breathe the abundant air. I wonder how it feels. What butterflies they must have. Are You looking for us? Or is there just confusion, or even knowing? <nl> The world turns in silence. Age has taken my hair, my health and my dreams, but it has not taken that fire and that hatred the War has wrought. I listen to the quiet. I feel the shadows from the great tower. It is dark here, soft purple dusk sprayed upon a cozy idea of hope. I feel the rumble of the engines start, hear the crew announce the test has been a success. <nl> We will leave soon. I will go and leave my home behind. But in the days remaining, I look and I stare. <nl> The fields sway in the night's wind. The moon is further than it ever has been. The stars blanket the black. There is a loneliness upon the land. The metal doors sigh. The Americans come out bewildered. They try their phones but no one answers. See how long their shadows are. See them search for that neighborly love. I wonder what they think. I wonder if they know. <nl> The ships will leave the day after tomorrow. The Sun will eat this Earth. We have burned all our intelligence, and have left no hope as to where we will go. Let the Americans have this planet. Let the temperature rise and engulf them. Perhaps their sweat shall stay their tears. But let them have this world. They have fought so hard for it. <nl> And let them look to the sky as we leave.

Ever since I'd left the army, that was pretty much all I did. Screw up. That, and once screw a woman I shouldn't have. No, that was unfair. I wouldn't have Claire, if it wasn't for that drunken night. ""Shit!"" If I didn't get to her in six minutes, I wouldn't have Claire at all -- ever again. I was already teetering on the edge of a precipice. This would be all the ammunition Elena needed to get me out of Claire's life for good. <nl> ""Shoes? Where are my shoes. Ah, come on."" I scanned the floor, kicking over cans and clothes as I tried to unearth them. ""Fuck it!"" I grabbed my jacket and headed to the front door barefoot, slamming it behind me. <nl> > Time remaining 5 minutes and 46 seconds <nl> I pulled the door handle, but it didn't open. I tugged again, harder. A familiar feeling washed over me as I padded my pants and realised I'd put on the wrong pair. No car-keys. No house-keys. <nl> My eyes ran to the reflection of the once proud, but now hunched, bleary eyed man in the car window's reflection. <nl> > Health 18% <nl> It had been going down steadily since I'd left the army -- since the injury and the indignant dismal. Slowly, but steadily, it had been going down. But the gentle decline had evidently turned into a precipice: I'd lost 6% since last seeing my reflection. It was like the HUD knew what was going to happen. That I was going to lose my little girl forever. That life had defeated me in a way that no enemy I'd fought in the army every could. <nl> > Time remaining, 4 minutes 58 seconds. <nl> I sunk my head into the crook of my elbows as I leaned against the car and wept. ""I'm so sorry, baby."" <nl>Time remaining: -1 minute 13 seconds.<nl><nl> The sound of laughter made me look up. A little girl and her mother walked past the driveway. The sound reminded me of my little princess, that day on the park swing as I pushed her far higher than I wanted to. Far higher than any of the other children. But that's what *she* had wanted, and she'd loved every second of it. <nl> ""Fuck it,"" I said, as I shrugged off my jacket. ""Daddy's coming, baby!"" I hurtled out of the drive and began to run, my barefeet slapping hard against the asphalt. <nl> > Time remaining, 3 minutes 26 seconds. <nl> It was at least a twenty minute walk to Elena's, and I hadn't run in years. Not like this, at any rate. Maybe to the off-license before it closed for another bottle of whatever shit I was in the mood for. I was barely down the street and could already feel my chest tightening. I avoided glancing in anything reflective for fear of my health. ""Don't die, Chris,"" I panted. ""Not today."" <nl> > Time remaining, 2 minutes 3 seconds. <nl> In the bottom of my vision, a rectangular overlay tracked my progress with a single red dot. I was going too damn slow. I looked around, my reflection be damned. Up ahead, leaning against a wall outside a house, was a small yellow bike covered with colourful flower print. <nl> There was an indignant yell as I jumped on it and began peddling. <nl> ""Sorry!"" I replied. ""I'll bring it back shortly!"" <nl> > Time remaining, 0 minutes 13 seconds. <nl> The houses passed me by in a blur. I pumped the pedals as if I was back in the army gym. Back before it had all gone to shit. <nl> > Time remaining, 0 minutes 4 seconds. <nl> I steered the bike into the drive and hopped off it, letting it fall to the ground. There! Elena was outside her house watering the plants. I sprinted the last few steps towards her. <nl> ""I-- I made it!"" I gasped. ""I made it! With two whole seconds to spare. Where is she, Elana? Where's my daughter?"" <nl> Elena's face fell as she saw me. ""Oh, Chris."" She put the down the watering can. <nl> ""Where is she, Elana?"" I repeated. <nl> ""Look at you... What happened this time?"" <nl> ""I want to see my daughter. Now!"" I added sternly. <nl> ""You're three hours late, Chris. And now she's out with her friends."" <nl> I checked my hud. <nl> > Mission succesfull <nl> ""Bullshit!"" I said through gritted teeth. ""That's utter bullshit. I was exactly on time."" I tapped my head. ""I can see it, you know. In here. You can't lie to me anymore."" <nl> She sighed as her eyes welled. ""Chris, please don't do this."" <nl> ""Do what, exactly? Fight for my little princess? Is that what you want -- me just to give up?"" I laughed. ""Of course it is."" <nl> ""For Christ's sake, she's seventeen, Chris. She's not your little princess anymore. And don't bring that HUD shit up. If the judge finds out that your're hallucinating again, you'll lose all contact with her -- regardless of what I want."" <nl> My ears screeched. I clasped my hands over them as I stepped back. ""No. No, no, no! This isn't right. This isn't right at all!"" <nl> ""Chris..."" A hand touched my shoulder. I turned. <nl> > Markus, Elana's fiance. <nl> ""Listen to me,"" he began. ""You need help. For your daughter's sake, but also, for *your* sake. You know, she didn't want you to turn up today? She's fucking scared of you -- and can you blame her? Let us help you. I know this great doctor. He's dealt with the kind of head trauma that yo--"" <nl> ""No,"" I begged, as I fell to my knees. <nl> The hud began to fade as tears streaked my face. <nl> ""Please, *no*. Not again. Not again. Not again. Not again."" <eos>

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> ######[](#dropcap) <nl> *Josh, let's have dinner at Goldie's.* <nl> Eric sent this brother a text, his left leg tapping nervously as he awaited the reply. They had never gotten along well--well, they had never gotten along period--but when it came down to it, he had to do the right thing. <nl> The right thing by him, by Josh, and by the world. <nl> So he had gotten in contact with his brother after two long years of not even bothering to call on his birthday. He couldn't let his brother, who was in a couple of days, going to have his self-created religion decreed by the President as the next official religion of the U.S., continue believing in the farce. <nl> When they were in high school, he had found that the heating system in their house was strange. Strange in that if you whispered closely enough to the vent, your voice could be heard in other vents around the house. And as his room was right next to Josh's, he had found great joy in pretending to be an omniscient being, terrorizing his brother and giving him commandments. <nl> Such as 'Thou shalt not drink wine with cheese.' <nl> And 'Thou shalt not step into puddles with one's left foot.' <nl> Somehow, within Johanism, Josh's constructed religion, those had morphed into two commandments: to be careful about the company one keeps, and to always put your right foot forward at the first sign of trouble. How on earth Josh had interpreted those pieces of advice from the random words that sprouted from his random bullshit, he would never know. <nl> ""Josh, hi!"" Upon seeing his brother, he waved him into their booth. Goldie's was the go-to restaurant they had gone to since childhood with their parents, and it brought back old memories, as few and far between as they were. ""In here!"" <nl> His brother, dressed in white robes and donning a hat--that Eric had to admit resembled a chef's hat--sat down next to him, giving him a large, generous smile and extending his arms out. ""Eric, my brother!"" <nl>You see,"" Eric began, ""I always remembered those commandments you made up when we were kids. 'Thou shalt not drink wine with cheese' and 'Thou shalt not step into puddles with one's left foot.' They were truly unique and stuck with me all these years."" <nl><nl> Eric awkwardly reached over the table to return the hug, ignoring the whispers around them. Josh had become a household name now, famous for his generous acts of kindness and strange pieces of advice he would offer to anyone who needed it, so his presence created a buzz. <nl> That made it worse, somehow. <nl> Eric cleared his throat. ""I wanted to tell you something."" The waitress walked over, setting a plate of fries down on the table--complimentary--and he moved back slightly to get out of the way. When she left, he spoke again, awkwardly avoiding Josh's intense gaze. His brother had always taken things so seriously, and that's what had compelled him to prank him in the first place. But it was better to get it over with quickly. <nl> ""You didn't really hear God's voice when we were younger. That was me talking through the vent. I just wanted you to know, not because I want you to feel bad about not being chosen by God or whatever, but because I feel guilty about it. And I completely understand if you don't want to talk to me again after this, but I'm really sorry. I was young and stupid."" <nl> There was silence. Eric's fist clenched as he waited for a reply. Josh simply looked at him, his expression unchanging. Then after a second, impossibly, he smiled. <nl> ""I know,"" he said simply. <nl> ""You...know?"" Eric asked in disbelief. <nl> ""Yeah, of course I knew. I just decided to go down this path anyway after you gave me the inspiration. People tend to believe in crazy a lot more than they believe in the sane."" He popped a fry in his mouth, chewing on it thoughtfully. <nl> Eric didn't know if he felt relief or not. After all, the issue that had been plaguing him had been resolved in the the blink of an eye, just like that, and his brother wasn't even mad. ""Okay,"" he said, feeling awkward. ""Thanks for forgiving me."" <nl> Josh didn't even bat an eyelash. ""No problem. 'Sometimes the cat likes the cheese too, and there's no shame in that,'"" he said, quoting one of Eric's lines back at him. Then he grinned. ""You had some pretty great pieces of advice, not gonna lie. Made me seem like a crazy person when I quoted the lines at bullies, but they all thought I was possessed or something and stopped messing with me. So thanks, bro."" <nl> ""No problem,"" Eric said. He grabbed a french fry, swirling it in ketchup before putting it in his mouth. It tasted better than he remembered. <nl> ***** <nl> r/AlannaWu <eos>

Story: <sos> To many humans, they take shit for granted. <nl> So you're from a planet; big whoop. <nl> You're used to having some heavier gravity. <nl> Maybe it's a colonial planet, with about a 1.2 version of Earth's gravity.  Or you're from the formerly blue planet, now more of a brownish vomit color, with that Coca Cola classic 1.0 set of gravity. <nl> Or maybe you're from one of those overpriced artificial biomes.  Or maybe you were born on one of the permanent orbital stations, instead of on the cold steel floor of a mining freighter like me. <nl> Now you've got some business meeting or whatever in a different star system.  You're all excited and shit, waiting to launch from orbit.  Most of your life you've taken things for granted.  Food that doesn't come in a God damn tube.  Not having to turn your piss into drinkable water every few hours.  Now you're on a spacecraft and the rules are different. <nl> But hey, we're all human here.  Mostly. <nl> Even have some children on board.  Which explains you lot trying to twist and turn all the pretty dials. <nl> So a particularly bright one of you lot bumps the gravity on your deck to maybe 85%.  No big deal, right? <nl> Wrong, dipshit. <nl> First you're sucking power from way too many systems for your ass to count, so the AI has to handle it.  It affects everything on board from burn rates to temperature levels, on top of rerouting every single damn deck system to coincide with this deck's gravity so you don't fall flat on your face when you transition. <nl> Then you have to sustain all that shit. <nl> So over a few weeks that power drain doesn't always go noticed.  Now you don't have enough to make it to your destination. <nl> You're stranded in the black void of space, with limited everything, hoping your comms system isn't too shitty so you can hail a rescue from a nearby shipping lane. <nl> If that doesn't work, your need to wipe your ass with the proper gravity level has literally killed every person on that craft. <nl> Or worse, the wrong ship picks up the system and now you're getting sold into slavery by God damn space pirates because you just couldn't get used to reduced gravity. <nl> You've single handedly doomed the entire crew to being some alien sex slave or for organ harvest on some God forsaken colony world. <nl> Can you live with that? <nl> So I won't say it again, Billy. <nl>Put on a weight vest, maybe wear magnetic boots and increase their connection level.<nl><nl> Hands off the fucking climate controls. <nl> Jesus stop with the crying, boy. <nl> Put on a weight vest, maybe wear magnetic boots and increase their connection level. <nl> If this is making you that nauseous take something with dimenhydranate in it.  I don't give a shit if it makes you sleepy. <nl> If I see you near this console again, I can guarantee I'm blasting your dumb ass out of the nearest airlock. <nl> Now run along and play with the other space brats. <nl> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <nl> r/storiesfromapotato <eos>

He moved carefully, slowly to the glowing box in one corner of the room. He pressed a thin finger against the side of the box, and the glowing disappeared. <nl> I stood up to greet him as he turned to me. I looked up at his eyes. They were losing their color. Most Masters think dogs don't notice things, but I do. I have been a good dog to my Master, and I have noticed many things. <nl> I noticed when he was not moving in his bed one morning. I noticed when another Master was going to attack mine from behind. I noticed when my Master brought home a new, tiny Master with no motor skills and a high-pitched squeal. <nl> ""George, ya ole mutt,"" my Master chuckled, reaching down to scratch my neck. I loved it when he scratched my neck! <nl>The Master picked up his staff from the table by the door and headed out into the forest, his thoughts on the upcoming battle with the dark lord. <nl> As he entered the forest, he felt a sense of calm wash over him, a feeling he hadn't experienced in a long time. It was as if the trees were whispering to him, guiding him towards his destiny.<nl><nl> As he pulled his hand back, I looked back into his eyes and tilted my head. <nl> My Master sat back down in his soft throne, leaned forward. ""I know, boy-o,"" he whispered, lifting my head with his hand, holding his cane in his other, ""I'm not looking so good. I'm not moving as fast as I used to, I can't do all of the things I used to do with you."" <nl> Moisture began to form around his eyes. I have seen this before, he is sad. My Master is sad, but why? Is it because he is getting old? Is it because of me? Did I do something wrong? I nudged my nose closer to him, making him chuckle. <nl> ""No, no, no,"" my Master smiled, ""you're good, ole boy, you're good."" <nl> Okay, good, it wasn't me. <nl> ""I do want to talk to you, though."" My Master stood up briefly then dropped to one knee, laying his cane on the ground. ""Sit for me, Georgie. I'm going to be going to the hospital soon. I hope this is just for some tests, but I'm not sure."" <nl> I tilted my head again. What is a ""hospital""? Is it like Hell? Or, in other words, the Vet? <nl> ""This is looking like my last trip to the hospital, boy-o."" <nl> Something about his tone did not sound right to me. Moisture was appearing in his eyes again. Why is my Master so sad now? What is going on? I scooted a little closer to him, licking his hand. Maybe licking his hand would make him feel better. <nl> ""Thank you, boy,"" my Master said, stroking my head. ""You've been a good boy so far. We've had some pretty fun times, too. Remember those muggers?"" He laughed a big laugh this time. ""What a time! Good thing I had this with me."" He picked up his cane, waved it at me. My tail wagged. <nl> ""I want you to know, boy-o, that I love you and that you have been the best friend anyone could have."" <nl> I have no idea what he just said, but he looked intensely into my eyes, and the moisture was gone, so I think he was happy.

Story: <sos> Firey tricks for dear friends <nl> \-WardogWhiskey <nl> &#x200B; <nl>As the night grew darker, my friends eagerly awaited my fiery trick. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a box of matches, igniting the flame that would astound them once again. Little did they know, my ability to breathe fire was actually innate, and the matches were simply a prop for the show. <nl><nl> For thousands of years I have walked this earth. The progress of humans had always astounded me. I am a dragon, I have no need for such advancements, but they sure do make life more... vivid. The tales you have heard of dragons are not very accurate. Yes we hoard treasure, yes we breathe fire, but we are not the beasts we have been out to be. Our pre-adolescent phases can be... volatile... but during my long life, I have seen much more terrifying human children. Few dragons exist, and we are able to transform between our reptilian forms, and our choice of human appearances. Our ability to change what we look like in our human bodies lets us live human lives much easier and safer. <nl> I have called many a man and beast my ""friend."" I have outlived all of them... so far. My friends of this life-time are very good ones, friends that strike me as special and stand out among the countless others. They treat me well, they are open with me, I can sense their true intentions and feelings. They are genuine in the things they do. <nl> As a dragon, I do have my hoard of riches, it is very secretive and something that not one other soul has laid eyes upon... and lived. My hoard is almost like a piece of me, it's not just wealth. I do use it to survive in this modern day human life, but sparingly. One piece of my ancient gold seems to have an astounding conversion rate with human currency. I live modestly, but comfortably. My friends are what make this human life-time more than average. One of our favorite things to do as a group is to go to a tavern. More commonly referred to as a ""bar"" in these times. Though the drink does take a toll on humans, it is nothing to me. It is quite enjoyable, and it helps fuel my fire. Once the drink takes a hold on me, my friends always demand my signature trick. <nl> I carry a box of matches with me to avoid suspicion when performing such a trick. I consume a small glass of highly concentrated drink, strike a match, put the flaming end into my mouth, and release a small puff of my fire. The match is only for show. My beloved friends do quite enjoy this, and it delights me to bring them such happiness and amazement. For during my short and ever fleeting time with this band of beings that are ever so important to me, I will ensure their pleasure in my company. It is the least I can do for their extraordinary kindness. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> &#x200B; <nl> I hope you guys enjoy this, I am an amateur and love writing for fun. Let me know if there are things to improve on, this was a kind of quick writing. It's very late, I'm tired, but I just had a moment of inspiration by this awesome prompt. <eos>

He did so, but then became startled. Something about the mineral deposit shifting. I think he was concerned about a cave in. <nl> The Commander radioed up for a scan. Everything came back clean. .7 on the richter scale I think - but within normal ranges. Command gave the OK to drill, but the Commander and Mallory went to a private comm for a few minutes.

The whole tunnel shook like crazy, and we could see the carbon fiber reinforcements start to buckle. I was at the back of the line. About 100 meters ahead I saw the lights on the borer just disappear, and we all heard Mallory screaming on the comms about blood and then nothing. <nl> I admit, I ran before the Commander gave the order. It's probably the only reason I'm alive today. Michaels waited and even the 20 seconds made all the difference. <nl> I ran up tube as fast as I could.

I was, not in control sir, I'm ashamed to say. <nl> It was around the 10 click marker that i heard the voice, if you could call it that. Same kind of thing from S1, only a lot louder.

That's the first time I looked behind me and saw there was nobody there. Just darkness and that voice. The quick evac took 30 seconds or so to warm up and as it did, that's when it happened sir. The tunnel just fell away. I mean, like there was nothing under it. If I hadn't been hooked into the evac line, I'd fallen myself. <nl> That's when I saw the lights of the borer, and Mallory's helmet all lit up inside, moving around. It's hard to gauge the distance, but I'd say he was at least a click away, on the other side of this new cave. <nl> Then it started moving - the whole borer with Mallory in it. Not of its own power, but upwards, through the cave, like it was floating or something. <nl> I told Comm Sat this, i know it sounds crazy and I guess it was too dark for me to see for certain, but I swear, right before the evac kicked in, Mallory's lights disappeared and, well, you know how your hand looks when you stick a bright flashlight up to it in the dark? Well that's what I saw. Just giant, glowing fingers closing in on him, and that damned voice speaking over and over. <nl> Then the evac kicked in and dragged me up tube. Now, here I am. <nl> ******* <nl> ******* <nl> NOTE: So this turned into a continuation or companion vignette from another prompt I wrote earlier today. I really enjoyed writing the other prompt and this prompt was awesome too, and since I'd accidentally set up the other prompt's entry in such a way as to make it compatible with this one, I decided to continue the progression of the story and effectively meld the two prompts into the same universe as I was writing this. <nl> So basically [Part 1 Can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7vcgqg/wp_you_wake_up_in_the_middle_of_the_night_to/) <eos>

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> As a nurse, I thought I knew pretty much everything there was to know about pain.  Not only from the perspective of my training, but thanks to my very unique and personal gift of being able to quantify pain into a discrete number.  It helps to a certain degree when it comes to triage and administering first aid; the complaining guy with the 1.2 over his head because he stubbed his toe hardly warrants my attention when there is a woman with a 37 over her head from the bulging spinal disc next door to him, despite her stoic demeanor. <nl> It is, admittedly, a little disappointing that I cannot turn off this ability.  No matter where I go, who I see, there's a number above their head.  For the most part I have learned to ignore it. <nl> That was until I met Gerald. <nl> I had just stepped onto my usual bus I take to work, and had sat down when I noticed the number floating above the head of the fellow in front of me.  I gasped:  800.  I'd never seen a number in the triple-digits before.  The highest I'd ever seen was a 73, and that number hovered over the head of someone who had been brought in after a house-fire, third-degree burns to 85% of his body.  And that 73 was already after the morphine he'd been given on the ambulance ride over.  He didn't survive, but in a way that was a blessing; it didn't take my ability to see the agony the poor man was in as he writhed upon the gurney as they wheeled him into the ER. <nl> I'd always kind of assumed that 100 was the most you could feel, based on my own experience.  I was sure that meant instant death, though I admit that doesn't always make sense; I watched many people with a 0.1 over their heads simply drop to the floor from a burst aneurysm.  Completely painless, but completely lethal.  But as far as pain goes?  I'm pretty sure 100 would be the end of you. <nl>I had always kind of assumed that 100 was the most you could feel, based on my own experience...<nl><nl> And yet there sat this man on the bus before me, reading the newspaper, 800 hovering over his head.  He looked perhaps late forties, early fifties tops, based on the grey in his otherwise brown hair, and I could see the ends of a pair of glasses over his ears.  Curiosity got the better of me, and I gently tapped him on the shoulder.  ""Excuse me, sir?"" <nl> ""Hmm?"" he turned, only mildly startled, and I was regarded by light brown eyes and the barest hint of a smile.  ""Yes?"" <nl> ""Uh, sir, pardon the intrusion.  My name's Elanor, I'm a nurse at Central.  I know this is highly unusual, but... are you feeling okay?"" <nl> ""Gerald,"" he replied, and his expression didn't change.  ""I suppose I am.  I don't feel sick, if that's what you mean."" <nl> ""Oh,"" I replied.  For a moment I sat in silence, searching his expression.  Gerald regarded me steadily.  ""It's just that, well, part of my job is being able to assess people's level of pain.  And... well, sir, it seems yours is..."" <nl> ""I'm fine,"" Gerald interjected, the smile that was barely present disappearing entirely.  ""I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine.""  And with that, he turned back around and resumed reading the paper. <nl> I bit my lip, but I knew better than to try and press the issue.  He wasn't a patient, merely a stranger on a bus, and I had no authority to go any further.  But how I wanted to!  My gaze drifted up, and I watched with growing concern as the number crept up to 803.  What was going on here? <nl> I had reached my stop, and as I disembarked I cast a quick glance at Gerald.  All I saw was the newspaper in front of his face.  With a sigh, I made my to the hospital. <nl> The rest of the day was typical, though today was my long shift, not due to finish until 10 that night.  It was just after 9 that the ambulance arrived, siren blaring and lights flashing.  I had barely made it to the ER when the EMTs blasted through the doors with a gurney, a mostly lifeless body upon it.  But still alive, for a number still hovered above its head; once a person dies, that number vanishes.  And the number above this patient was 813. <nl> I stopped short, immediately robbed of breath, for two reasons.  One, I knew it was Gerald, for I recognized the same clothes he'd been wearing when he rode the bus.  And two, because that was the only way I could recognize him; his face was gone, a mess of obliterated bone and tissue with an ET tube poking out of it, and immediately I recognized the end result of a botched suicide by shotgun.  This injury isn't new to me.  The suicidal often try to take their own lives in this fashion, but with the effort of trying to reach the trigger with the end of the barrel jammed under their chin they end up tilting their head back, and the force of the blast does not go towards the brain, but instead up and forwards.  They often survive, sometimes only for a while, sometimes going on to have their face reconstructed by incredible surgeons who give them a second chance at life.  If they were lucky, they retained an eye or two, but many would go on to live blind. <nl> Gerald was still alive, but it seemed there would be no ability to see for him, as there was no sign of his eyes in the shredded mess of what used to be his face.  As I set up a second central line in Gerald's arm, hooking him up to the infusion pump that would at least temporarily keep him alive, I watched in horror as the number crept up to 829. <nl> As the rest of the team of doctors and nurses rushed to pump pain relief, antibiotics, and attach him to ECG and EEG, I had a moment to ask the first responding EMT Gerald's circumstances. <nl> ""Neighbor phoned it in,"" was the response.  ""Heard a single shot."" <nl> ""Family?"" I inquired.  The EMT shook his head. <nl> ""He lived alone, apparently."" <nl> And that's all there was time for before people scattered to their respective duties.  If there was no immediate family living with Gerald, that meant any existing family would need to be found and alerted to the situation, and what would come next depended on whether Gerald had a living will.  In the meantime, we were obligated to keep him alive. <nl> But as I watched the number above his head creep to 836, I was not sure that was the right path to take... <eos>

Story: <sos> Night hangs over the city like an inky black shroud, cloaking it in darkness. <nl> And under cover of darkness, the city springs to life. The airways are buzzing tonight - it's a big sales night, and countless deliveries are being flown to countless homes. The city's like a living organism on nights like these - the airways blood vessels, the drones blood cells, the packages life-giving oxygen. Buy this, buy that. Do you really need another back-scratcher? Another boxed set of DVDs? Of course you do. One-click purchase makes it easier than ever. Buy now, and it'll be at your doorstep in an hour or less. Capitalism is alive and well, and everyone in this city wants something. <nl> Unfortunately for our friendly neighborhood megacorporations, not everyone wants to pay. <nl> The modified rotors of the custom Aspect T25 slice through the icy night air. It's an interesting beast. Though designed as a heavy construction drone, the T25 has two main selling points that Aspect Systems refuses to openly advertise. One, the hardpoints for attaching construction equipment are compatible (by sheer coincidence, mind you) with highly illegal 'whammy' drone-to-drone disruptor weaponry. <nl> And two, it's built like a flying tank. <nl> It's point two that keeps Griffin's drone in the air tonight. The highly customized drone strains under the weight of its stolen cargo, swaying after the loss of two of its rotors. It's a heavy loss, but Griffin is no ordinary pilot, and he can fly with six rotors, no sweat. Under his careful guidance, the T25 slips out of Airway C23546 and goes off the grid. Its identifier blinks off, and its carefully arranged stealth fields flicker on. It's now invisible to all but the most sophisticated detectors. Many miles away, Griffin pushes up his goggles as the autopilot kicks in to fly the Twenty-Five home. <nl> ""How's the haul tonight, Griff?"" A voice crackles in through his headset. <nl> ""Pretty shit. Some knockoff Gen 1 phasers out of China, busted me up pretty good when they saw my approach and got a few shots off. I'll be lucky if the haul pays for repairs."" Griffin lies smoothly. In this business, bragging only invites jealousy - or worse, robbery. <nl> ""Hah, I keep telling you, man - gotta get your hands on one of the new Vipers. They've got a new blade design that's almost silent. You could fly one in a fuckin' library. And they've got the sensor cross-section of a flea."" <nl> ""Sure, Q. As long as you don't mind it going down when a stray rock hits it."" <nl> ""Come on! The gen twos can survive most small-arms fire."" <nl>I could really go for a slice of pizza right about now,"" Griffin muttered to himself, his stomach growling in agreement.<nl>""CONTACT: INCOMING SATO SECURITY. FIVE SATO X-50'S ON INTERCEPT.<nl><nl> ""Uhhuh. Hey, I gotta go - I'll catch you later, okay?"" <nl> ""Sure."" The line goes dead with a click, and Griff leans back in his seat, wiping his brow. He lifts a half-empty drink can to his lips, drains it, and sighs. Despite what he's told Q, there's no knockoff phaser package strapped to his drone's belly. <nl> A stolen combat drone prototype hangs in the T25's magnetized claws. It's the latest out of Sato Robotics' R&D department. It sports pulse weapons, nanosteel layered armor, the latest sensor packages, and a top speed of almost 400 miles an hour. It's worth a fortune. <nl> And Sato's not about to let it go without a fight. Suddenly, a blaring tone echoes through the basement. <nl> CONTACT: INCOMING SATO SECURITY. FOUR SATO X-50'S ON INTERCEPT. <nl> Briefly, he considers dropping the package, letting the Sato drones recover it. If his drone goes down in a fight with Sato's X-50s, he won't have enough money left to buy another. He'd lose everything. <nl> Then again, the risk is worth it. <nl> He cracks his knuckles and pulls his headset back on. <nl> --- <nl> *Want more? Join /r/OneMillionWords* <eos>

'Does that help them get what they want?' <nl> The genie paused, reflecting. 'No,' he said eventually. 'No, not often. But still... think of the possibilities, boy. You could be richer than all the merchants of history. You could have wealth beyond measure. You could be to the great Mansa Musa as the great Mansa Musa to the lowliest street urchin.' <nl> 'That wouldn't make me happy.' <nl> The genie scratched his head. 'That doesn't usually stop people,' he said. 'Forget money, then. What about power? Women *love* power.' <nl> I paused; perhaps he hadn't understood. 'I don't...' <nl> 'A President,' he interrupted. 'A *King*, even. You could have armies at your command with a click of my fingers. Just think of how readily this girl would fall at your feet then.' <nl> 'I don't think Sam's really going to be impressed by the whole men-in-uniform thing,' I said. *Although you never know...* <nl> 'Why falter, then?' he asked.

'You said you loved this Samantha of yours, boy.' <nl> 'I do. It's... complicated.' <nl> 'But you do not wish for her to love you. It could be done in an instant.' <nl> 'I'm sure. But it wouldn't count. It wouldn't be real.' <nl> He grinned a sickly grin: powerful, sly. 'She would never know.' <nl> 'I would.' <nl> 'And what of it? These trifling things are forgotten in time, when the world comes to rest at your doorstep. Happiness makes a man lose sight of these minor quibbles.' <nl> 'I don't. Want. *That*,' I hissed through gritted teeth. 'I don't want any of that.' <nl> For a moment, the genie's eyes flashed red with the rage of centuries. 'You have courage, boy,' he said. 'More than you think. Perhaps you do not need this wish at all.' <nl> *Oh, I do*, I think. *Oh, I really do.* That was the thing about life with Sam: we'd known each other for years, and none of that made it any easier. We had a relationship without lies, without worries, without secrets -- except one. No matter what I did, no matter how I tried to broach the topic, the words always caught in my throat, treacle-sticky and coarse as beach sand. If I had courage, it wouldn't have taken me seventeen years to say what I'd been sure of ever since I was a kid. There was only one thing I needed in the world, and that was for Sam to *know*. To know every part of me. To have it all. <nl> I knew that we could never be anything more than friends, but that didn't change the facts. <nl> 'I just want the conversation to go well,' I said. 'Not even that. I just want to keep my nerve for long enough to tell Sam. That's all.' <nl> 'To tell her what.' <nl> 'Him,' I said, quietly. <nl> A long moment stretched, doubled, folded in on itself and repeated; it didn't surprise me. Who knew how long the genie had been there, trapped in brass? Who knew how much the world had changed? Did they even *have* people like me the last time he was out? <nl> 'I see,' said the genie eventually. His voice had lost its echo. It was warmer, now; strong and firm and without judgement. I had never heard anything quite like it. 'And you do not wish him to love you?' <nl> I shook my head. Sam *did* love me; I was sure of that. We were like brothers. There was no genie in the world that could undo that -- and no wish that would make me want it changed. I knew he couldn't love me the way I loved him -- not now, not ever -- but that was OK. I didn't want to change him. God, that was just about the *last* thing I wanted. 'No,' I said. 'Just to understand. You know... *what I am*. Does that make sense?' <nl> For the first time, an honest smile spread across his face. 'It has been known,' he said. 'The world is wider than you might understand, boy. There are stranger things on every corner.' <nl> 'So?' I asked, fumbling the coins in my pocket. 'How much?' <nl> *How much for a wish?* <nl> *How much for my happiness?* <nl> *How much for two little words?* <nl> And the genie laughed and laughed. <nl> _____ <nl> I'm back, baby!

In that moment, everything became as transparent as a shined up old mirror. Humanity would be forever blighted by their inexhaustible ignorance and unending stupidity, until the day they wastefully used it all up. <nl> How, you might ask, had it all become so suddenly clear to me? Allow me to elucidate: I had been so ridiculously dumbened by this man's comment, that I'd somehow gone beyond the wibbly-wobbly scale of stupidity and come out the other side - I had become super-hyper-intelligent, stupid. My wife explains it like this: imagine, if you can, falling down a big old well as a bog standard garden llama, and then coming out the other side as a one legged mongoose dancing the midnight foxtrot. That's what happened to me. <nl> There's more science and biological stuff to it than that probably, but part of being so smart is being able to explain all this in language any old dolt can understand. <nl> So, I could see it all. Our stupidity would soon tug hard at a loose thread on the dress of humanity, unravelling it, leaving her naked and embarrassed in front of pervert predator planets, such as Pluto. The figurative future of humanity was laid out bare before me (and what a figure!) Our ignorance would be our oblivion. We would launch nukes and squabble with our neighbours, until we brought rise to our own extinction, leaving us to start out all over again as cavemen. <nl> *Unless...* unless there was a way to make humanity become as dumb - as smart - as *dumb-smart,* as me. *But how?* The question followed me around like a too-long tail that was often getting snagged in bushes, for the better part of a year.

It took me years of planning (and endless consultations with my pastor) just to come up with the name. The Ken part came first, and was slightly easier - a subtle nod and wink to my own name, Kenny. In the end, it was my wife who made a GOOD point about using the M - it came from the first letter of my daughter's favourite pasta, macaroni. <nl>Little did I know, the elderly gentleman was actually my long lost twin brother who had been separated at birth and sent to live in a parallel universe where memories were as fleeting as a mayfly's lifespan.

He looked back at the screen with confusion. <nl> ""Why was there an old meme on the board"" Bob thought. <nl> Why, it had to be over a hundred years old. Then it hit him, all that time they had spent on his disguise, his camouflage they called it. All superfluous. He couldn't help himself, the absurdity of it all was too much. <nl> He erred in the biggest way possible, the one thing he could never do. He laughed, and once he started he couldn't stop,  he knew he needed to, but that made it worse, made him laugh harder. He knew it was over, he knew they would find out, and all the horrors that came along with that revelation would soon be here. When he finally gained his composure he became aware that every eye in the room was trained on him. <nl> ""Would you like to let us in on the joke, Bob the Qxi?"" Said the professor. <nl> ""Fuck it"" Bob thought to himself. <nl> He immediately stood up and placed two fingers under his mask, pushing the quick release hidden in a fold between the mask and his suit. The disguise slithered off, exposing his naked body to the class. <nl> ""THAT'S NOT A HUMAN BEING!"" Bob shouted as he pointed to the board. <nl> ""THIS IS A HUMAN BEING"" Bob pointed to himself. <nl> Bob was breathing heavily, scanning the room, wondering where security would come from to take him away. Everyone was starring at him with.. bemusement? Embarrassment? It was hard to tell. <nl> ""And praytell, Bob the Qxi, if this is not a human being, what is it?"" Said the professor with an air of bored superiority mixed with annoyance. <nl> ""It's a Dickbutt"" said Bob in a matter of fact way. <nl> The professor let out a small sigh... or a chuckle, or maybe both. He stood up and started a slow clap with all hands in unison. Seven golf claps simultaneously as he looked at Bob the Qxi. <nl> ""Glad to see we've identified the class clown, Bob the 'human'. Now, I have to say I'm rather impressed with your dedication to your craft, Bob the 'human, but next time you're going to pull a prank in my class, please don't shed your skin in front of the other students. There are many different species with many different backgrounds. Remember your micro-aggression training from orientation before you act out in this manner again, Bob the 'human'. Do you understand?"" <nl> ""Uh... yes"" Bob said as he took his seat, naked and bemused. <nl> The professor began his lesson and Bob the 'human' pulled up the text book on the tablet built into his desk, flipped to chapter one, and began to learn all about the anatomy of a Dickbutt. <nl> The end. <eos>

Story: <sos> https://reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/7vb2fu/problem_with_my_bathroom_mirror/ <nl> &nbsp; <nl> **Problem with my bathroom mirror?** <nl> &nbsp; <nl> Hi guys. I have a kind of... strange problem with my mirror. I'm just wondering if anyone has seen this before? <nl> You know that feeling you get when someone is watching you? That creepy, invirtuous crawl that ranges up and down your spine? You know? <nl> One morning last year, I started to feel it in my bathroom. I was brushing my teeth. I turned around, checked the window. Still frosted, and closed. I looked around for cameras (Silly, I know, but who knows what the NSA is up to these days?). Perhaps my poops were a matter of national security. Hell, my farts had been described as 'biological warfare' by my last girlfriend, so it wasn't too much of a stretch. <nl> In any case, I'd found nothing. I put it out of my mind and learned to ignore the spindly spider at the back of it, niggling with every routine. <nl> That is, until this morning. I'd read a TIL the day before: something about fingertips on mirrors. If there's a space, it's a normal mirror. If not, it's two way. You guys have probably seen it. So in the middle of my mouthwash, out of sheer boredom, I put my finger up to the mirror. <nl>I think it was my imagination, though.<nl><nl> No gap. I was so surprised, I nearly choked on my mouthwash, and spat it up down the sink. In the process, I guess I took my hand off of it. <nl> When I looked back up, I put my finger back. This time, there was a gap. It was really weird. I felt like something really, strangely ominous was watching me. It was a much heavier feeling than before. It felt like a warning, or something. Like when your parents reprimand you when you're really young. I'm not sure, but it definitely wasn't me, because when I left the bathroom the feeling just... dissolved. Completely, in an instant. It was weird. <nl> Do you guys have any explanation for this? I'm hoping that the sciencey side of reddit comes to help me lol. I've been really hesitant to go into the bathroom since then, and my housemate didn't like me using his shower this evening. I know it's stupid, but I don't even want to brush my teeth in there tonight. <nl> Could it be something to do with the mercury? I know mirrors have that in them, but I don't really know what it does? <nl> I don't want to seem dramatic, but I'm kind of creeped out, so any help would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance. <nl> ----- <nl> I'll write a part two if there's demand for it. <eos>

My second is that I'm way too stoned, my eyes glancing at the half-smoked joint sitting in the ashtray on the porch. <nl> I'm dead sure I just heard Jax speak. And now there are howls in the distance, a chorus of neighborhood dogs calling to one another, Jax included. <nl> ""Can you repeat that?"" I say, forming the words slowly. <nl> Jax abruptly halts his call to the skies, one paw still resting on the chewed up orange ball. ""You need to get inside."" <nl> I try to comprehend the situation, my muscles involuntarily locking, with only my eyes flitting back and forth between Jax, the lawn, the half smoked joint and the orange ball. Something wet hits my bare foot, causing me to snap out of my paralysis. I swipe at the long line of drool hanging from the corner of my mouth. <nl> ""Get inside,"" Jax says again in some sort of bastard approximation of his bark. <nl> I turn and walk back to the house, still not quite understanding but now starting to accept - despite the absurd improbability of the situation - that my golden retriever is talking to me. <nl> ""Hurry, Abe,"" Jax says, nuzzling his snout against my ass. ""There isn't much time."" <nl> I sit down on the living room couch, scratching my head in a caricature of confusion. ""What in the world..."" I say, mouthing the words silently as I stare out the window at Jax, who is now rapidly digging a hole in the front lawn with a dedication quite unbecoming of the lazy, irreverent best friend I thought I knew. <nl> Another line of drool drapes itself across my knee and slowly steeps to the floor, forgotten. Jax pulls out what looks like a flak vest and a riot helmet and somehow dons them, then begins to howl again. The howl has a deep sense of purpose behind it, almost like a battle cry, like some sort of canine call to action. <nl> My dog flashes a look back in my direction. His eyes contain a deep intelligence that wasn't there before. <nl><sos> I sit there, frozen with fear as Jax stands his ground, ready to defend me against the approaching black creature. <nl> Suddenly, I remember that Jax is a cat. <nl>#Suddenly, I remember that Jax is a cat.<nl><nl> Noticing my discomfort and confusion, Jax bounds up to the window. ""We are man's best friend,"" he growls through the glass, puffing up his chest with pride.  ""To defend you is our true purpose."" <nl> A woman is sprinting down the street, causing Jax to snap back around and crouch low. She screams a terrible, blood curdling yell as something black streaks across the pavement and cannons into her, causing her to flail into the concrete. The creature rips the back of the woman's head to shreds before she even comes to a stop. I'm pretty sure it is Samantha, the kind lady down the street. <nl> The black creature stops, satisfied with Samantha's splayed, lifeless form, then it turns and looks me dead in the eye, it's fangs glistening with bright red blood. <nl> ""Fucking cats,"" Jax says, setting his shoulders. <eos>

""Magnus, what in the Hellheim,"" I stated, not missing my chance to drop a reference. ""Look, I know this is a lot for you to take in right now, but you gotta listen carefully. You're my favorite book character, I know how your story ends, and I need to change it. Fast."" <nl> ""Wait-what. Lemme pull a UNO reverse card straight here, you're *my* favorite character!"" I stated, pointing an accusing finger at him. ""What?"" he said in disbelief, and in those seconds I had never felt more meme-like. ""There's no time for this!"" He pushed past me, looking at the clock. 4:45. ""Oh, no no no. We have to get ready *fast.*"" He whipped his head towards me, taking my arm. ""Get everything you can carry in a small backpack,"" he ordered walking me quickly towards my room. I obeyed, taking a backpack and shoving in clothes, my phone, a laptop and other precious sundry. Even a deck of UNO was shoved in. ""Do you have a rock?"" he asked quickly. ""No, why?"" <nl> ""We need to get a rock!"" he said loudly, tromping through my house. He tried the back door to the yard, pulling on it in frustration. I nudged him aside, taking a key out from the shelf. ""Hurry, hurry!"" he said, sounding stressed and desperate. I shoved the key in, turned, and went out into the yard. He went around, looking through the dirt and plants for one. ""Got it!"" a rock was raised into the air in a triumphant fist. ""Call your friends, we need them here earlier,"" he said, calmer now. I took out my phone and messaged the group chat with ""get over here i found magnus chase"". Some contemplation followed, then a ""seriously gt over"". I heard a whooshing noise, like lots of tiny marbles across hardwood. ""It's time,"" Magnus said, looking up. ""The Sand's here."" <eos>

Earlier that day I'd broken one digging a drain trench out behind the barn. <nl> Now I was sitting at a table in a room with a long mirror along the wall. The kind you see in a cop movie where they are shaking down a suspect. <nl>They found the body in the shed out behind the barn. He'd been dead for at least three days."" <nl>  12<nl><nl> Oh fuck. I'm a suspect.  But for what. I barely leave the farm. <nl> ""We can do this the easy way or the hard way"", and middle aged man in a suit was entering the room . He had a briefcase and a tablet. Closely behind him was another man. He appeared to be some high ranking military officer. <nl> ""Umm I really don't......."" I was cut off. <nl> ""Don't play dumb with us James. You have to know why you're here.""   he was clearly annoyed with me. <nl> Then it hit me. Dad's brother Pete spends a lot of time up in the back corner of the farm at the edge of the forest and he always smells like weed. <nl> ""That mother fucker! Listen, it was dad's brother. He's always up there. If you're looking for the weed he's the guy you want!

Story: <sos> I started keeping my own personal time by counting cycles of my fingernails growing; I clipped them every three weeks before time stopped. Every time before, time stopped for only a short period. Once, it was a car swerving out of control, headed in my direction. Another, a crazed gunman at university. Once I had removed myself from the situation, everything returned to normal, with no one else any the wiser. This time was different; I've clipped my nails 17 times. Nearly a year, give or take, of time that I've spent alone in this world. <nl> I still come home to you every night. There you are, never moving, with your favorite show on the television. It's paused on a scene I've come to memorize every pixel of. I take a seat next to you on the couch and pretend that you're here with me still. <nl> You'd be surprised how clean the house stays when you aren't here. The trash doesn't pile up in the can or in every corner of the house. You'd be surprised how quiet the house is when you're gone. Instead of the daily screaming matches we would find ourselves in, the only thing I can hear is the sound of my own thoughts. The thing I find myself the most surprised by is the feeling of freedom that I have; I've left the house without an angry phone call. I don't have to worry you're going to show up at my work when I have to stay late. I've even went to see my parents a few times. <nl> *Your eyes, though frozen in time, still held that fire that I loved so much. I noticed, however, that they were not fixated solely on the television like I had assumed all this time. They seemed to be glancing slightly to the left: the safe I kept my pistol in.* That's when I realized. <nl>*Every night, I sit with you on the couch, my fingers brushing against yours. I whisper in your frozen ear all the things I wish I had said when you were still alive. You never respond, but I continue, hoping one day you'll hear me.*<nl><nl> _________________ <nl> *Edited ending.* <eos>

Story: <sos> Ayers Rock is famous for many reasons: as an Aboriginal holy site, as a milestone marking the center of a continent, or simply as a bloody large rock in the middle of a very flat desert. <nl> To those in the know, it has a very different significance. <nl> Everyone thinks they know the history of Australia. A forgotten continent, populated by all manner of creatures weird and wonderful. Kangaroos. Captain Cook. Convicts. But this is merely what those in the know want you to think. <nl> Similarly, when 49 heavily armed alien spaceships entered the Solar System and demanded immediate surrender from both Earth and Callista, most of Earth's inhabitants assumed that this was the first time that such an event had occurred. The Callistan's were not so ignorant, and immediately retreated into the bunkers that they'd long held ready. <nl>I grabbed my bag from the chair. ""Let's go then,"" I said, eager to get this over with. We left the Prime Minister's office, heading down the hallway towards the exit. I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement at the thought of what awaited us at Ayers Rock.<nl><nl> In the United States, established cults immediately began proclaiming that this was the long-prophesized end of times, and everyone else blamed the President. In China, the government attempted to censor all mention of the aliens until the beings in question simply bypassed the Great Firewall and directly invaded their minds with the ease of a modern Genghis Khan. In Russia, they merely shook their heads and rolled their eyes. <nl> In Australia, the Prime Minister's urgent conference call with his top generals was interrupted by a soft knock on the door. ""Not now, dammit. I'm busy."" <nl> The knock came again. ""What the hell is it?"" <nl> The door opened and a slender woman smiled at the Prime Minister. He had a sudden feeling that things were going to be alright now that she was here. He rubbed his face irritably. What a ridiculous notion. <nl> ""Prime Minister, I've been assigned to you from the Atlantis Protocol."" <nl> ""Never heard of it."" <nl> ""Of course not,"" she said, smiling as if this were perfectly understandable. ""We're classified."" <nl> ""If you were, I'd have heard of you. Now get out. I've got a country to save."" <nl> She stood their patiently, her smile not wavering. ""I'm afraid we're classified above Head of State level."" <nl> ""Dave, I'll call you back,"" the Prime Minister said into the phone, and replaced the receiver. ""Explain yourself. Who are you, and how did you get in here? You say you're assigned to me? What's that, some kind of aide?"" <nl> She laughed. ""How quaint. No, I'm afraid I'm a little more than your aide. I'm here to inform you that your lease has been terminated, effective immediately."" <nl> ""Lease?"" <nl> ""Do try to keep up, Prime Minister, we don't have a lot of time. Your lease on Atlantis."" <nl> ""Atlantis as in the mythical Greek city that sunk beneath the waves?"" <nl> ""A convenient fiction,"" she said. ""Atlantis as in the Advanced Terran Laser And Nuclear Threat Incapacitation System."" <nl> ""And this thing is in Australia?"" <nl> ""No Prime Minister. It *is* Australia."" She waved a hand towards the window. The Prime Minister suddenly realized that wisps of white mist were drifting past his window. That's funny, he thought, we don't get fog in Canberra. Then he had a sudden panic that this was some alien weapon. Only when the room lurched suddenly, and the mist gave way to the brilliant blue of space, did he realize that they had been clouds. <nl> He turned to the woman. ""What the hell?"" <nl> ""I'll explain on the way,"" she said. ""Come. We need to get to the command center."" <nl> ""Where's that?"" <nl> She gave him a funny look, her patience finally appearing to wear a little thin. ""Where do you think?

There's no need to add insult to injury and give me something that I had to fill out. <nl> ""I really don't want to take this."" <nl> The angel pauses in front of me, smiling kindly as she sets the test on my desk. <nl> ""I know. We know that tests aren't your forte, but this is a Reincarnation Aptitude Test. It determines what you qualify for for your reincarnation experience."" She winks at me before I glance down at the test and then back up at her. <nl> ""I'm not going to try on this."" <nl> ""I know."" <nl> She walks to the next person who obviously overheard our conversation. She explains quickly to the angel how excited she is to be reincarnated as a horse and dives into the test with a sort of vigor I will never know. As for myself, I do my best not to fall asleep as I circle questions randomly, sighing and writing down philosophical bullshit on the short answer sections. This is all not worth the three minutes of freefall I went through that led to my death. <nl> Always make sure your parachute works, kids. <nl> After I am done with the test (that was about two hundred questions too long), I turn it in to the strange lock box at the front of the room. The angel smiles at me and points across the room to another door. <nl> ""You may wait in there for your results. Have a wonderful new life!"" I manage a smile as I make my way across the room to the door. I open it to find another small waiting room where another man sits, rubbing his hands together. I realize there's another person in there too- a young girl -who is standing away from the man. <nl> I close the door and clear my throat awkwardly. <nl> ""How long have you two been here?"" I ask, trying to break the silence. <nl> ""Five minutes."" The little girl answers me with a small smile. It's tense. ""How'd you die?"" <nl> ""Faulty parachute. You?"" She shrugs. <nl> ""Eh, turns out dads suck."" I give her a sympathetic look and she waves me off. It's a strange action for a girl who looks as young as her- it makes me feel uneasy. ""Hopefully I'll get another shot at it."" <nl> ""I hope so too."" I say softly. ""Hopefully this time with a less sucky dad."" She laughs a little, still tense. <nl> ""Fingers crossed."" She replies. ""What do you think you'll be reincarnated as?"" <nl> ""Probably a racoon."" I say, causing her to giggle. ""I guessed on everything."" <nl> ""I only guessed on two!"" She claims proudly. ""The one about-"" <nl> ""Quintin?"" A voice suddenly sounds through the room, soft and delicate; the girl and I both look to the man in the corner as he stands abruptly. ""You have been reincarnated as a Killer Whale. Prepare for rebirth."" He nods, staring straight ahead. He doesn't acknowledge either of us when he suddenly poofs out of the room in a cloud of smoke. My eyes widen and my jaw drops. A silence passes between us, and I swallow thickly. <nl> ""He wasn't very talkative."" The little girl says, breaking the silence. ""No fun."" She wanders over to me and looks as though she's about to sit down when another voice rings through the space. <nl> ""Astrid,"" this voice is different, more matter of fact, ""you have qualified for another human life. Prepare for rebirth."" She turns and grins at me, giving me a thumbs up. <nl>I glance down at my watch and realize I've been waiting for over a week.<nl><nl> ""Dreams do come true."" She winks. <nl> ""Have fun."" I say before she poofs out of the room in the same puff of smoke. <nl> I'm left alone, and I wait. And wait. And wait... and wait. <nl> People come in and poof away and yet I sit and wait. I wonder what is happening because, *hello*, I have been here for the whole day. I have watched people meltdown at their result, and I have watched people jump for joy- there have rarely been any in between. <nl> And then suddenly, it happens. <nl> ""Oswald,"" I stand, three pairs of eyes turning towards me, ""your results are extraordinary. Prepare for the divinity gathering."" I make a face. <nl> ""What?"" I mutter, poofing out of the room. I yell involuntarily as my center of gravity shifts, my body feeling like it's being tossed and turned in mid-air. Without any warning I fall into a chair, the wind knocked out of my chest. <nl> I gasp for breath as something like energy flushes through my veins- It's like my body was given an adrenaline hike -and I shove myself up from the chair. I grasp at my chest as I am met with the edge of a table, using my free hand to brace myself- I end up splashing into some soup. <nl> ""Gross!"" I groan, shaking out my hand even as it trembles with the strange energy coursing through me. I look up at that moment to see a woman with bright crimson hair staring directly back at me, her mouth agape and bright brown eyes twinkling despite her shock. <nl> ""What the hell."" She says, standing up from her chair and tilting her head at me. All at once, I am struck by her beauty and I find myself blushing as she leans forward. ""Another?"" <nl> ""Another?"" I nearly scream as a man speaks. I whip to the side, finding an older gentleman; his long white hair reminds me of the stereotypical vision of God, and I look around the table to find several others staring back at me. <nl> ""Another god!"" The woman at the head of the table chirps. She stands as well, and I immediately notice her freckles and bright bubblegum hair. ""It's been too long since we've had someone new join us, welcome!"" <nl> ""Uh... thank you."" I somehow manage the words, although it feels like I'm speaking through cotton. ""Where am I?"" <nl> ""In the Heavens."" The head of the table speaks absently, others leaning over to each other and speaking in low tones. She moves onto her own question. ""What may your powers be?"" I shake my head. <nl> ""I have no clue."" I reply- wanting to tell them all that there's been some sort of mistake. There's no way I could qualify for divinity, there's absolutely no freaking way! This is all some massive prank that I am privy to- <nl> ""-listening?."" The woman across from me interrupts my train of thought. I feel myself flush again as she speaks. ""Hold out your hands."" I do as she instructs and she grabs my hands, pulling them towards her and shutting her eyes. I watch her, swallowing thickly before she suddenly smiles. <nl> ""God of destruction."" She says, all of the others breaking into their own conversations. I look to my hands when she releases them. I curl them into fists and turn them over to look at the backs of them. <nl> ""Destruction?"" I murmur. <nl> ""It's funny."" The woman at the head of the table says. ""So far anything in the human world that's related to destruction has been of Angie's accord."" The red head raises her hand so I know who she's referring to. ""But now it's up to you..."" She leaves it open for me to fill in. <nl> Despite everything leading up to this moment, all the confusion and all the doubt, I decide that even if this is a prank- I'm going to make the most out of it. <nl> In a way, me ending up here was a bit of a disaster. It's only fitting for me to be the god of destruction. <nl> ""Oswald."" I tell them. ""It's nice to meet you."" <eos>

That bastard pervert is on TV again"" Al shouted from his armchair through a mouth full of prestils. Doloris, avoiding the saliva saturated projectiles, turned to Al "" I'm sitting right next to you Allan you dont have to shout"" she said quietly. There was a time when Doloris would have cursed him into next Tuesday with a flick of her wrist for the meer indication that he would mutter a word with his mouth full. However things had changed Al was old and deaf and seemed to be deteriorating by the day. ""This smut shouldn't be allowed before the 9pm watershed, does this man not realise the havock that would be unleashed if Hex education was a part of high school curriculum?"" Al posed this as a question but Doloris knew he could neither hear her or cared about her opinion. Doloris rose gingerly from her spot on the sofa and made her way to the kitchen to fix herself a coffee. Al was shouting at the TV again, this would continue all day until he had his evening drink(spiked with just a touch nightshade to help the old sod sleep). <nl> Doloris thought about her time in highschool often these days. She wondered if anything could have been differnt if they had the kind of Hex education so prevalent in the media. In her day you learned by word of mouth. Is your husband drinking too much? You can use the alcofeto curse to put an end to that. Speaks with his mouth full? A simple incantation of cronos accelerom and he will speed through the meal none the wiser. <nl> She had heard roumors of people having adverse reactions to the curses but as Al told her time and time again this was hippy propaganda. <nl> But when she looked at him, really looked at her once strong and fierce lover he seemed 20 years older than her. This was odd, she thought. They had met at 17, married at 20. Why had he aged so terribly? Why was she still in control of her facilities and he was losing his grasp by the day? <nl> Doloris never liked such negative thoughts.

The genie sighed, waiting for the dog to return. <nl> It came back with the stick in her mouth, looking immensely proud of herself.

""Please do not waste any more of my time."" <nl> ""Bark!"" the dog replied. <nl> ""No, you cannot wish for the same thing twice. You have already wasted one wish; do not waste them further.

The succulent fruit grew wildly all over the side of the mountain, covering the gray rock with thick roots and lush leaves. <nl> The rapidly filling basket weighed heavily on Evelyn's arm, and she stopped to catch her breath. In the hazy distance, a jagged skyline of Florence rose out of the dark green carpet of the Italian countryside. She'd always wondered what it would be like living there, to walk the busy streets, see all the wonders of art and science. <nl>He always woke up with that gleam of curiosity in his eyes.<nl><nl> With a sigh, she lifted the basket and started dragging it back toward the mansion. Her dad had always told her that the city was best left alone, but her new master had shown her some of his strange inventions and had promised to take her there someday. <nl> ""Hey! Excuse me!"" <nl> A woman stepped out from behind a boulder. Her dark hair grew into her eyes, and a smile curved her lips. Evelyn felt the basket leave her hand. The oranges spilled down the side of the hill. Wide-eyed, Evelyn stared at the woman as she dusted off her shoulders and then hurried over. <nl> ""I didn't mean to frighten you!"" she said, chasing the escaping fruits. ""I'm not from around these parts."" <nl> ""I... where did you? I mean... *what do you want*?"" Evelyn said, narrowing her eyes. <nl> The woman wore a man's attire with trousers and an offensively tight tunic, which shoved every curve of her body. Her sleeves extended into shiny gloves of some strange material. An unusual pinging noise came from the woman's pocket and she pulled out a tablet of some sort. It was glossy like the surface of a calm lake. <nl> ""Huh..."" the woman muttered and ran a hand through her dark locks. ""Interesting..."" <nl> She swept her finger over the surface and brought the tablet up to her face. <nl> ""What is that thing?"" <nl> ""Oh, um, nothing,"" the woman said, putting it away. ""Does anyone live nearby?"" <nl> ""Only my master,"" Evelyn said. <nl> ""Can you take me to him?"" <nl> Evelyn shook her head. ""He doesn't like to be disturbed."" <nl> ""Trust me, in my case he would."" The woman flashed a winning smile. ""I've traveled a long way to meet him."" <nl> ""Fine, follow me."" Evelyn took the half-full basket and dragged it up the hill, back to the mansion. <nl> She found her master in the courtyard. It was unusual to see him awake at this hour, but he appeared ready and eager to start the day. His fingers worked to position an easel for the right lighting. It was one of the things she admired about him. He always woke up with that gleam of curiosity in his eyes. <nl> ""Hello there!"" the woman said, breaking away from Evelyn and ignoring proper introductions. ""Leonardo Da Vinci, right?"" <nl> A wrinkle appeared between his bushy eyebrows. ""That is right. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking to?"" <nl> The woman smiled sagely and sat down in the only chair in the garden. She once again pulled out the tablet. ""I'm ready when you are."" <nl> Evelyn hurried up to the woman, barely able to hide her outrage. ""I'm sorry, master. I'll make her leave, or else get the guards here to do so."" <nl> ""Okay, hold on!"" the woman said and looked at Da Vinci. ""You've had an urge to paint for a while, but you haven't been able to decide what; true?"" <nl> The artist nodded slowly. An expression Evelyn hadn't seen before spread across his face. He lifted an eyebrow and his mouth opened slightly. Surprise. <nl> ""How about you paint me?"" the woman said. ""Just let me know the password to the wifi, so I have something to do."" <nl> ""I'm intrigued,"" Da Vinci said. ""Tell me your name and I'll consider not having you thrown off the property."" <nl> ""Lisa,"" the woman said and a mysterious smile danced across her lips. <nl> *** <nl> **Thanks for the gold!** <nl> r/Lilwa_Dexel <eos>

This couldn't be real. Why had I never heard of ARC? I wasn't a replica... I wasn't. I left my dad's office and hurried down to the kitchen. I grabbed a knife and held it for a few moments. *Was I going insane?* I bit my lower lip and ran the knife's edge across the skin on my arm. Nothing happened, my skin was unhurt. I checked the knife - it at least *looked* sharp. So why didn't it cut me? I tried again, with more pressure, and using the point at the tip of the knife, but I couldn't cut through my skin. My hands began to tremble and I dropped the knife onto the floor. *I couldn't hurt myself*. Either, I wasn't allowed to, or my skin was made of something incredibly dense. *When was the last time I bled? When did I last hurt myself?* <nl> It was three years ago. I was on my bike, and dad was reversing out of the drive and he went a little too fast, he'd been in a rush - and... I'd hurt my head.

My head was fine. <nl> I hadn't thought about the incident since it happened. Dad's hair was longer back then, and darker. But when I woke, it was almost a crew-cut. *Jesus...* <nl> I ran back up stairs and into dad's office.

Remi smiled to himself, *Classic bait and switch doesn't feel too good does it?* Grouchily, but satisfied with his mini revenge, he went through the cat flap and out into the garden. <nl> He swatted at some flies and slapped some leaves out of his way muttering annoyances. ""How could they lie to me? I'm two whole years old and they waited that long to tell me?"" He yowled in frustration. <nl> ""Whats got you down sour puss?"" Asked the neighbor cat.

""Look Remi, what do you see?"" <nl> ""Two paws"". <nl> ""Right, they're the same aren't they?"" <nl> ""Yes"", he whispered. <nl> ""Now imagine your mom and dads paws, they look different right?"" <nl> Remi thought about it for a moment.

I asked. <nl> I opened the door to the kitchen, and my wife burst towards us inside of a massive fireball. ""You don't even remember?!"" she shrieked.

I felt the heat of her anger rising, to the point where the entire orphanage felt like a damned furnace. <nl> ""Yeah, and when I asked if you wanted to go for a bike ride, you told me 'no',"" came her voice from somewhere in the coiling smoke. <nl> It filtered through my nostrils, squeezing the life out of my lungs. ""Yeah...?"" I coughed. <nl> *Neeeeed. Aiiiiiiir*. <nl> ""Well, I was offended by your tone."" <nl> My mind whirred. The smoke was making me delirious.

I double checked the children. They seemed to be okay. Woozy, sure, and one *might* have been passed out. But otherwise fine. <nl> ""Yes! Your tone.

I'd had a long day--you of all people should know--the last thing I'd meant was to be rude."" <nl> As I leaped towards salvation, the flames reached out and snagged me.

I don't want this to turn into another Bruce situation."" <nl> *And boom goes the dynamite.* <nl> The root of all our problems--as few and far between as they were--related back to her previous marriage.

Destiny. <nl> There's no other way to explain it. Just the single greatest invention in the history of time that, by the way, rewrites the history of time. No biggie. <nl> Yet, here before me, this putz sits on his God damn throne, making his minstrels play Kanye West tunes while I stand slack jawed unaware how the fuck he did it. <nl> His face is withered, with scars along the edge of his left cheek. It would look scary but he covers most of his face with a thick beard. As far as royalty goes, he looks like he's had a hard fight for this throne. <nl> Cause that's the terrible fucking thing about time travel: it's never certain. Like, did I invent time travel? And he's just from the future where I've sold patent? Or did he invent time travel and decided to rule a kingdom? <nl> Christ, I have a headache already. <nl> ""How?"" I finally mutter. <nl> ""Same as you broseph. I traveled through time,"" He smiles and brushes a long strand of grey hair out of his face. <nl> ""But..."" I start to stammer but he cuts me off. <nl> ""Bro, you want taquitos. I gave them a recipe and you'll never believe how good they taste. Like, all food, bro.

I asked her. <nl> ""What do you mean, silly!"" she smiled at me, tilting her head ever so slightly. Her long, ginger hair flowed over her shoulders. ""I'm Jessie, and we work together for almost three years!"" <nl> ""Josh, it's not funny"" Said Brendan, my boss. He looked at me with serious eyes. ""I need you two to file this report until the 7th. We don't have much time"" he handed me a pile of papers. <nl> ""Boss, I'm not joking. I don't know her!"" I said furiously. ""Are you trying to mess with me?"" deep down I knew it wasn't possible. Brendan wasn't exactly the funny type of person. <nl>I need you two to file this report by the 5th. We don't have much time,"" Brendan handed me a pile of papers.<nl><nl> Brendan took off his glasses and rubbed his nose bridge. ""I don't have time for this nonsense. You two figure it out"". He stomped his way to his room. <nl> Jessie was still smiling at me, with an almost unhuman expression. She opened her eyes way too wide. ""I don't buy it"" I hissed. ""Tell me who you are"". ""I'm Jessie, and I think it would be in your best interests to believe me"". Her face darkened, and she revealed a perfect row of bright, white teeth. After a second or so, her face relaxed and went back to normal. <nl> ""Hmmm... okay..."" I said nervously, as her smile grew even larger. Who is she, I thought to myself. Crazy ideas ran through my mind. Why does Brendan acts like he knows her? Am I the only one who knows something's wrong, or... <nl> ""Yo Josh! Jessie!"" I heard my friend, Roy, shouts from the other end of the office. He sprinted towards us, almost toppling over a pile of paperwork on his way. He came to a halt in front of Jessie, grabbed her by the waist, and gave her a kiss on the lips. She played along. <nl> ""WHAT? NO!"" I lost it. They broke apart and looked at me. ""You don't know her! I don't know her!"" <nl> ""Are you crazy, Josh?"" Roy said, slightly pissed. ""Jessie and I have been together for over one year now, and..."" <nl> ""OH REALLY?"" my anger grew stronger. ""Then what is her last name? How did you meet? What is her role in the office?"" <nl> Until now, Jessie just stood there and watched me having a mental break down. The moment I raised those questions, fear appeared on her face. ""Honey, come on! Don't listen to him!"" she leaned towards Roy and whispered to his ear. ""He doesn't know what he's talking about. You should ask him nicely to take a break from work, he lost it completely."" She pulled some sort of stick from her back pocket, trying to hide it from my sight. <nl> Roy's Confusion was apparent. ""I can't remember, sugar... I really don't know you"". He looked in her eyes. ""Who are you?"" <nl> A spark, and then a loud boom, went off from the end of the stick Jessie was holding. Roy's eyes rolled inside their sockets, he fainted and fell to the ground. She pointed the wand at me. <nl> Now it was apparent that she was unhuman. Her skin turned grey, her ginger hair became rusty, and her eyes was wide open. She was a witch. <nl> ""I knew it! I knew I'm not crazy!"" I said with triumph, but I quickly realized the danger I'm in. people in the office were screaming and running for cover. <nl> ""You should've stayed out of the way, mortal!"" she cried. ""I don't know why my magic haven't affected you, but I'm going to make sure you won't be able to trouble me anymore!"" <nl> She waved her wand, and I raised my arms to cover my face. A strong flash of light hit me, and I felt like I'm turning blind. The light slowly faded away, and I could see the witch's confused face. <nl> ""That was... supposed to finish you."" She mumbled. ""No mortal can survive the power of my spells!"" <nl> My body was vibrating. I didn't feel weak anymore. I didn't feel scared anymore. I looked at the tips of my fingers. They were flickering with white light. I pointed my hand at the witch. She looked at me in horror and shock. ""Please... forgive me!"" She bowed in front of me. <nl> ""No"" I said, but the voice that came out wasn't mine: It was a primal, ancient voice. I opened my mouth, my hand pointing at the terrified witch. Lightings came out from the tips of my fingers, shocked the witch, and I roared with a voice that could be heard from five blocks away: <nl> ""BEGONE, THOT!"" <eos>

No matter dog, rat, deer, snake, raccoon, or the smallest bird that no one would think twice about. If there was a poor little creature which had its life cut short by some person who was too busy rushing through their own, she would always pray. <nl> Soon after getting my license and my own car I found myself saying this same prayer. Maybe it was out of habit, maybe I thought that it is something everyone does, maybe because if I didn't then who would? Either way I never missed. Every animal, every time. <nl> Years went by, and even though I would get some weird looks from passengers, or ignorant comments by people who seem to think that the lives of creatures other than themselves have no meaning, I still prayed for them. <nl> All but one. <nl> ""This is YOUR fault!"" <nl> The words hit me hard, and so did the memories of an elk suddenly jumping in front of my car. The memories of pulling the wheel harder than I ever have before. The memories of a brown flash moving across my windshield. The memories of nothing at all. <nl>I remember the small raccoon off of I-5, the beautiful porcupine next to Highway 41, the opossum I buried next to Third Street.""<nl><nl> ""I don't understand, what is my fault?"" <nl> I slowly begin to notice the thousands of different animals greeting me, as if they know me. Not just as if they know me, but thankful to know me. <nl> ""No not you, I will be with you in a moment."" <nl> I was confused to say the least, but happy. As soon as I realized that I know these animals too. For some reason I can remember each and every one. I remember the small raccoon off of I-5, the beautiful porcupine next to Highway 41, the opossum I buried next to Third Street. <nl> ""This is your fault. You know it is a special occasion today and I was under the impression that you would behave!"" <nl> I now notice a man speaking to a very beautiful grey and white colored cat. Smokey. My cat. The one that ran away when I was 8 years old, the one I remember seeing from the school bus window a few blocks from my house. I knew it was her that day. <nl> The man was scolding Smokey for tearing up a piece of furniture that I'm assuming was for me to sit on. She was always a feisty one. <nl> He turned away after giving her a little pat on the head, no one can stay mad looking at that face. <nl> ""Hello! These wonderful creatures are only here to give you a warm welcome, then they're back off to their own pieces of heaven. You are the reason they are here and they seem to be very thankful for that. Except Smokey seems to forget that not everything is a scratching post, my apologies."" <nl> He turned to look at Smokey, but she was already preoccupied with playing around on something else. <nl> ""Anyways, feel free to formally meet all these fine animals and enjoy yourself!"" <nl> ""Oh! And one last thing, someone very close to you must have the same tradition because we just received a new guest."" <nl> At that moment the most beautiful Elk I have ever seen walked through the crowd to rest it's head on my lap. It seemed upset, but with a few words I knew would calm him. <nl> ""Be at peace."" <eos>

Story: <sos> The creature first visited me on a long, lonely night, another sleepless, dreadful twilight  that I was spending brooding over the pointlessness of my existence. <nl> It crept into my house and swept me up off the couch with ease, gripping me tightly, my face inches away from rows of razor sharp teeth. <nl> '*This is it,*' I thought to myself. '*Finally...*' <nl> But the creature did not bite my head off, or rip me limb from limb; No, its long, cat-like tongue extended from its horrid mouth and scraped across my face -leaving me drenched in its rank saliva. <nl>Wait, you came back?"" I asked, confused. ""But you were here last night.<nl><nl> It let out a foul wail and released me from its grasp. ""**Disgusting!**"" It bellowed in a disappointing tone. <nl> ""Sorry..."" I was accustomed to apologizing, I've always had a way of ruining things up for folks. <nl> The creature left me soaked in my living room, and returned the following night for another attempt. Only this time, it had me eat a handful of herbs it pulled from a large pouch. They tasted bland, I never really had much of an appetite for anything. <nl> Again, the creature sampled my flesh with its tongue and again it was repulsed. <nl> And so, this began our nightly routine. The creature would return, feed me herbs and spices, sample the seasoning, and wail in disgust. I began to feel sorry that I continually disappointed the beast, and hoped one day it would find the right mixture of seasoning to end it all. <nl> Nearly a month of the creature's visits, and I'd come to anticipate its arrival. At this point in my life, this monster was the closest thing to a friend I had. <nl> But one night, the creature never arrived. I sat up waiting until the sun finally peaked over the hills, and I accepted the fact that the creature had given up on me -as everyone else in my life already had. <nl> However, to my surprise, the next night the creature returned! Oh, I felt such joy when I witnessed its massive form creep up from behind and into my vision. <nl> ""I thought you'd moved on."" I said with a faint smile. <nl> The creature examined me intently before speaking. ""**Something different tonight...**"" <nl> Without reaching into its bag of herbs and spices, the creature stuck out its tongue and sampled my face. I welcomed the warm embrace, like a hug from a friend I hadn't seen in ages, and, this time, the creature didn't withdraw in disgust. <nl> ""**Hmmm, not bad!**"" The creature nodded its massive head. ""**Feeling better?**"" <nl> I looked down at the floor, realizing that I was probably about to be eaten. ""You came back; You didn't give up on me..."" <nl> The creature paused, and I'm not sure, but I think I saw slight pools welling up in its eyes. <nl> It didn't eat me that night, or the next, or the night after that. It doesn't come every night now, but it stops by a few times a week and tastes my flesh. I'm not sure if it plans on eating me, but I know I can count on it being there -and that's enough for me. <nl> /r/BeagleTales <eos>

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> Sydney was ten when she found the lamp, ten years old, fifth grade, a rough time for a young girl trying to prepare herself for middle school. Middle school, they said, was when life stopped being about fun and started being about work. Life got serious at middle school. Gone would be the days of games and laughs. In their place would be tasks that had a lasting effect on your life. Gone were the days of 'want to be my friend?' instead replaced by harsh judgment. <nl> Sydney, ten years old, shivered at the thought because fifth grade hadn't been much in the rainbows and sunshine department. The idea that sixth grade would be worse was enough to make the girl do anything to wish for a better experience. It was enough to make her wish she could be good enough for it. <nl> *Please let it be better,* she thought. <nl> But that's not what she said as the small bedroom filled with blue smoke and the booming demand for a wish. <nl> Not 'better'. Not 'ok'. Not 'good'. <nl> 'Perfect.' <nl> And there started the problem. <nl> Sixth grade started on her eleventh birthday and was heralded in with enough of a summer transformation to keep the students' jaws dropped. It was flattering attention but when Syndey's cheeks flushed, it wasn't the ugly red tomato face she was used to. No, her face remained its ivory hue, so subtly different from the blotchy pale, and only her cheeks blushed glowing apple red. <nl> The first day of classes flew by, a blur of perfect answers and new friends. Invites to clubs, tryouts, study groups. <nl> *The genie was right. This is going to be perfect.* <nl> A child often lacks a degree of foresight. It's why we ought not let them make permanent decisions on their future without a degree of time to think it over. And really, maybe all Sydney needed was time. <nl> But with the gusto of a little girl, she plunged in headfirst. She greeted high school a changed person, all smirks and eyerolls cause why not? Why be bubbly, why take any shit, why let even the slightest thing bother her? <nl>She became a child prodigy, earning a Ph.D. at age 21 and quickly escalating to criminal activities, but somewhere in her twisted path, she found a sense of twisted justice.<nl><nl> Do homework at home? She could doodle idle thoughts in her notebook on the bus and get As. So home was for clubs and hangouts. But as the shine of winning games, acing performances, and collecting awards, those too faded from her schedule. More hangouts. More parties. <nl> By senior year, she rocked the heroin chic look as effort faded from her wardrobe, leaving her 'would look good in a trash bag' body decked out in slouchy, effortlessly sexy torn jeans and ratty, unwashed t-shirts. Why wash them? She never smelled bad anyway. <nl> She got into Harvard. MIT. Oxford. If you've heard of it, she got into it. Got the Ivy League gamut. Tried them all out too. Bounced from school to school, semester to semester. Why not? Every scholarship was a full ride, every subject a breeze. <nl> Every bit of it boring. <nl> It's not really fair to judge her for what would have almost certainly become should the wish have tumbled from the lips of anyone else. It's not fair to judge her. <nl> But perhaps some did as she turned from legitimacy to a new high. Why stay within the lines? Could anyone catch her if she blurred them? Stepped over them? Rules were meant for people who couldn't get away with breaking them anyway. <nl> And thus the next chapter of her life began, the evening after getting her Ph.D. at age 21. It had been easy. Of course it had been. Maybe this would be harder. <nl> Break-ins quickly lost their charm. Vandalism was child's play. Bank robberies, gallery robberies, scams and cons, they were good fun for a little while but Sydney was rapidly losing interest and within a year, found herself looking for something a little more thrilling. <nl> Twenty-two is an awful young age to have run out of passion for anything but the most terrifying. But terrifying is the next path she took. <nl> Perhaps it started with the idea of good. After all, somewhere deep down there, ten-year-old Sydney is still longing for fulfillment. And ten-year-olds like nothing more than superheroes. <nl> Twelve years of reading 'someone ought to do something' on articles about murderers and rapists cleared led Sydney to her first kill. It had been so simple. So obvious. The man had been so clearly guilty. Guilty and lucky. Guilty and wealthy. Guilty and popular. <nl> But not guilty and perfect. He'd paid for the string of deaths in his wake. They ended with Sydney. <nl> Finally, here was something she could do without fear of it getting old. Gone was the old drug of adrenaline, replaced by the thrill of justice. Why hadn't she done this sooner? <nl> Of course, even the evil of the world can become boring. Everything can become boring. Why hadn't Sydney seen that at a younger age? <nl> She didn't ever come to enjoy the actual act of killing. The lust for righteousness, maybe, but never the act. Three years in and she was done with it too. <nl> It wasn't the right way. The right way was to instill a system that wouldn't have allowed them to get away with their crimes in the first place. <nl> You likely understand where this story is going now. Or why I have to tell it in muted whispers when the enforcers aren't around to hear. She never really meant any harm. To any adult who'd studied any degree of history, her path was predictable. But she'd only been a child. And life is hard for a child. School and peers, it's hard to see the forest for the trees. <nl> I hope that, amid this story, you've had some ideas for how to move forward, how to save us from the tyrannical rule of our benevolent dictator. <nl> I'm out of time for the rest of her story. Her rise to power. How that all went down. Perhaps another time, but the enforcers are returning shortly. <nl> If you've heard enough, please send help. <nl> Sydney may, at heart, still be a child worth saving. Perhaps she's nothing more than wicked and blighted. Maybe she's just confused and yearning for something to fulfill her. <nl> But she's also something so much worse than all that. <nl> She's perfect. <nl> ___ <nl> Read more stories at [r/TalesByOpheliaCyanide](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesByOpheliaCyanide/) <eos>

Halfway across the world here I was, and in the shadows of the Eiffle Tower she reached up to take off her sunglasses. That's when I spotted that precious bare skin, like a gift sent down from heaven for me. <nl> ""Pardone moi!"" I screamed in my terrible, terrible French and rushed toward her, ""Je suis... eh... Tu..."" <nl> ""It's okay, I'm American,"" she said back with a tone that betrayed nothing if not boredom, ""What is it?"" <nl> American! It wouldn't have mattered at all, of course, but knowing that she speaks my language, knows my world, it made the entire situation that much sweeter. To top it off, she was gorgeous, easily more gorgeous than any woman I'd seen in years. <nl> ""Your wrist!"" I immediately fumbled out, pointing toward her arm, ""You don't have one either! I've never seen anyone else that didn't have it!"" <nl>I reached for my phone to call her, realizing too late that I had forgotten it back at the hotel. <nl><nl> ""Ha, good one,"" she shot back as she dismissively waved her arm toward my own wrist. Of course I was far too nervous, I should have told her that I draw mine on. <nl> ""No, no!"" I stuttered out, holding up my wrist, ""This thing? This thing is--"" <nl> ""Fake, right? You draw it on? Or no, wait, it's a stamp? Yeah, yeah. I've heard 'em all."" <nl> ""What?"" I said back, confused. <nl> ""Listen bozo, you're not the first guy to try this, and I'm not interested. I'm not some one-night stand, you prick, and the fact that I'm destined to look around for anybody out there who may or may not exist doesn't have me too excited to play these stupid little pick-up games."" <nl> ""No! I promise you"" I hurriedly yelled out, ""Just look, I'll wash it off! Come with me, there's a cafe around the corner and watch me wash it off!"" <nl> ""Riiiight, cafe around the corner. You don't quit, do you? Well I do,"" she finished and briskly walked off. I tried to chase after, but in moments she flooded into a crowd and disappeared. <eos>

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> The thing about average is, you can see it a million times and still not notice it. That's kind of the point. Average is unspectacular, but never bad. Average isn't the expectation, but it's so close to it that you can always find a logical reason for why it's shown up again. And again and again. <nl> No one wants to be average. It's just inevitably where we end up. <nl> For me, average has been there since the beginning. No one noticed it, of course. That's just how average works. <nl> I've got a brother and a sister. They came first. Then me. And then, shortly after I was born, my father received a letter in the mail informing him that 1) he had a son in Vietnam he'd never heard of before, and 2) that son had stepped on a landmine, blowing off all of his limbs. But he'd survived. So I've got half a half-brother in Vietnam, which in my eyes makes us a family of 3.25 kids. <nl> Perfectly average. <nl> My grades were perfectly average all throughout school which was only ever noteworthy for the terrible consistency of it all. No A's, no D's. No peaks, no troughs. There was the thought that maybe I was cheating, but if I was it was an extremely modest sort of cheating, which no one could work up the energy to worry about. More puzzling was the overwhelming average-ness of my class and my school and my county and my state. Average. Year in and year out. In math and science, English and history. I was an average student in an average school in an average county in the dead center of the most absurdly average state in the Union. <nl> It was perplexing, but again, it was *average* and average is a difficult thing to investigate. By it's very nature, it's where everyone's *supposed* to be, so how concerned ought anyone be by it? We were the *most* average, after all. That was almost something to aspire to. <nl> When I left my home state for college, it suddenly began to achieve at a much higher rate. The spell of average was broken. Admittedly, I didn't notice. <nl> There were other things happening. <nl> The university president - the highest paid public official in the state at that time - was forced to resign on the back of an enormous harassment and discrimination scandal. There was lasting backlash at the executive level, followed by mass resignations. Meanwhile, the university's service workers managed to form an alarmingly competent union. The ultimate outcome was that seemingly everyone working at the university suddenly made the exact same wage. Which just so happened to be average wage at the time. <nl> Interesting. But why in the world would I think that had anything to do with me? <nl> My relationships all last 4.2 years. <nl> I eat 46 slices of pizza each year. <nl> My penis is 5.1 inches when erect. <nl> Eventually, all that *average* is all I could see. There was no ahead, there was no behind. And everywhere I went, the average came with me. Soaring cities slowed down instantly, as economies and social progress ground down to the national average. Struggling companies surged to a blessed middle ground - but never any higher. <nl> It wasn't until my father died at age 76 and years later my mother died at age 81, that it occurred to me that even my tragedies were average. And I began to realize how much we take average for granted. And how for some, average would be a blessing. <nl> So I traveled. I spent time in war torn countries, picking through rubble and cracked clay roads. If I was average, I was safe. And if the people living there could be average, then perhaps their days might not be so frightening. <nl> Of course, there was still death. There will always be death. But it was smoothed out a bit. Children grew up. Eventually they died, but in the interim they lived. <nl> I sought ways to spread my power, but it always came with me, leaving when I left. In the end, it really wasn't much of a power after all. <nl> I found a small town, bleak and impoverished, and this is where I'll stay for now. There was a brief time when I thought I could save everyone. I thought I could find a global mid-point between famine and excess and death and avarice. But the Earth finds her own mid-point. Humanity creates her own average. I'm just an aberration. An aberration of average. <nl> But for this town average is a pleasant diversion. Unless things have changed, I've only got a few years left. A few years of middling mediocrity. <nl> Thankfully I'm quite fond of mediocrity. <eos>
<nl><nl> But as I settled into my new life in the small town, I realized that I had actually left a trail of chaos and destruction in my wake. The towns I had visited were now filled with disease, poverty, and despair. I had unwittingly brought misfortune wherever I went, a stark contrast to the average life I had imagined for myself.<nl> I tried to ignore the guilt that plagued me, but it only grew stronger as the years passed. Eventually, I could no longer live with myself, and I set out on a journey to make amends for my actions. <",

Of course I helped them. Those videos were their happiness, the light and melody in the darkness of their worn, grating clocks. <nl> Their videos weren't complex. Not at all. They were as simple as they could be. They sat in front of the camera and talked about their days, sending messages of love to the world. <nl> Everything started because they knew there were children out there whose parents or grandfathers weren't around anymore, and to them, what they did, was a way of reaching out to those kids, embrace them with their casual yet tender words. <nl> ""One is enough,"" they used to say when their view count was on the single digits. <nl> Time went by, as it always does, and one of the clocks ceased grinding. My mother, cheerful, joyful, beautiful as she was passed away at ninety, and she did so peacefully in her sleep. <nl> Her passing broke me, and shattered my father in ways no words could ever explain. The pain had been unbearable, and so my father had ceased doing videos for a long time. Until one day I got a notification. He'd uploaded a new video explaining his absence. His followers, which had grown to the tens of thousands, had sent him endless comments full of loving words. <nl>We love you, forever,"" the video ended, leaving me with a bittersweet ache in my chest. As I closed my eyes, I could almost hear my parents' laughter and feel their warm embrace surrounding me in a comforting hug. # 6
<r> That night, I fell asleep with tears on my cheeks, grateful for the treasure trove of memories my parents had left behind for me to cherish.<nl><nl> I still remember how thrilled and happy he'd been when he'd read them. Tears had fallen down his cheeks like tiny creeks scurrying into the folds of his skin, but they'd been tears of joy. He'd embraced me, and in a frail whisper he'd said, ""See how kind people can be if you are kind to them?"" <nl> A week ago, my father passed the same way my mother did: in the calmness of his sleep. <nl> Now there are two hollows within me. And those hollows would never be full again; but that was all right, for with the emptiness came remembrance, and the remembrance always made me smile. <nl> They had told me, long ago, that when they were here no more, I had to log into their account. And that's what I did. There, I found a video they hadn't uploaded. It was titled, ""When we are gone,"" and it was addressed to me. <nl> In that video my mother cried, and my father did his best to remain serene. ""The day will come, Tommy,"" they said. ""If you feel the need to cry, do it. There's no shame in that. But never think that you weren't good enough, or that you could've done things better. You were more than enough, so much more. You were the light of our eyes, the reason of our happiness. We enjoyed every second of our time, and that was thanks to you. <nl> ""We love you, forever."" <nl> ------------------------------------------ <nl> r/NoahElowyn -- If you enjoyed the story, consider checking out my sub, I have many stories over there! <eos>

Story: <sos> ""Calm down everyone!"" yelled Silk, as he approached a bustling crowd surrounding the entrance to St Mary's train-station. He massaged his temples through his mask with a single index finger. Did the crowd have to be so freaking loud? It had been one of those day's at work -- one stress after another; he really wasn't in the mood for faux-heroics. <nl> He should have given Martin a call at lunchtime. Told him tonight was off. That's what he *should* have done. But he thought he'd be feeling better. Now what options did he have? Neither of them carried their phones when in costume (no pockets in their tights), so if he was going to calm this crowd down, he'd have to find Martin and 'pacify' him. <nl> In his left hand -- the one not massaging his head in an effort to stop it exploding -- he held a little brown bucket. <nl> ""It's Silk!"" shouted an onlooker. ""Thank God it's you, Silk! Thank God!"" <nl> He looked at the lady and tried to smile, but it turned instantly into a gaping yawn. ""Is... Is it Beat-Hooven again?"" he asked lazily. <nl> ""Yes! He's on the train. And he's got a whole lot of hostages. I think he's going to kill them!"" <nl> Silk stuck out his tongue and bit down. ""Difficult situation. Very tricky. But, I'll see what I can do."" He placed the bucket down where he was standing and gave his usual speech-cum-terms-and-conditions. ""Thank you all for being here tonight to help me. Through your cheering and positivity I will not just battle my oldest and gravest foe, but I will defeat him!"" He lowered his voice slightly and could feel his cheeks redden. ""*If you'd like to support me outside of these situations, please consider leaving a donation in the bucket here. It's easy being a hero -- it's not easy paying rent in a city like this. And as for the medical expenses...*"" <nl> And with that, he began wading through the crowd. Hands pawed at him, trying to touch the hero, to encourage him. But it only slowed him. Irritated him. Like being in quicksand, he thought-grumbled. <nl> Only a few of his most ardent supporters followed him into the station -- most people's joy at seeing their idol was trumped by the fear of mortal danger. And even those few had scattered by the time he'd climbed the steps and made it to the tracks. On them, was a long iron monster, belching and rocking. All windows and doors were closed, but he could see pale faces inside that had turned to look at him, pressed against the glass. <nl> He raised his hands to his mouth and yelled, ""Beat-Hooven! It is I, *Silk*. Your battle is with me, not the innocent passengers of that train! Let them go and come out and face me, mano-a-mano!"" <nl> Moments passed. Minutes. Martin, he thought in annoyance, will you please stop showboating. I'm not in the mood. I just want to get home and play a little playstation, eat a little pizza, and say goodnight to this shitty day. <nl> Finally, the train hissed and the doors opened. <nl> Passengers scuttled out from it as if a dam had been opened. They mostly thanked him as they passed and wished him good luck. <nl> ""Donation bucket is outside the station!"" he said. He noticed most of the men and women were in business suits. Good train to hijack, he thought. At least Martin had got that right -- we should easily get a enough for a pizza or two. <nl>He looked at the lady and tried to smile, but it turned instantly into a gaping yawn.""<nl><nl> Music trickled out from the train. A soft sonata. Silk let himself relax, let his posture slouch, as he drifted into the music. <nl> He was just starting to feel somewhat calm, when Beat-Hooven jumped off the train. <nl> ""Silk!"" he screamed maniacally. ""Prepare for a crescendo! You shall become my most famous requiem!"" <nl> Silk glanced around him. No passengers had stayed. Good. He turned back to Martin. ""Cut it out, Mart. My head is about to explode, I swear."" <nl> Beat-Hooven glared at him and whispered, ""Stay in character, idiot. Besides, blowing up isn't your power."" <nl> ""There's no one here. So relax. And I know it's not my power, but I've got a pretty nasty migraine and--"" <nl> ""Oh please,"" Martin said, rolling his eyes. ""A headache. That's what you've got. If you had a migraine you'd be chucking up in a gutter right now. You've no idea how bad they are."" <nl> ""Whatever. My head hurts. Can we just go?"" <nl> ""Go?"" Martin looked annoyed. ""What about the spectacle? The show?"" He held out a hand and poked Silk in his chest. ""What about all the carefully choreographed heroics we've been practising night after night, hour after--ouch!"" <nl> Silk had grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back. <nl> ""Let me go! That frikking hurts, idiot."" <nl> ""We're going home. Now. I'm going to march you like this out of the station, so people can see that I defeated you, and we can maybe rustle up a few more donations. Then, we're off. I'll fly you to 'jail' or something."" <nl> Martin grumbled as Silk pushed him back into the station, down the stairs, and back out into the street. <nl> ""What..."" Silk said in surprise. <nl> Martin let out a stifled laugh. <nl> ""What..."" Silk repeated. No one was there. No crowd. No bucket. Someone had taken their donation bucket! Well that was just great! Wait, not no one. One young boy was standing there, back against the wall. <nl> ""Hey! Kid!"" Silk cried out. ""Where'd everyone go?"" <nl> The boy turned to him. ""Oh. NightRaven showed up on 4th street threatening to blow up the block. Word is Eve is heading there to confront her."" <nl> Silk let out a weary sigh. He couldn't believe Janette and Claudia would do this on one of *their* nights -- again!. They'd agreed to the timetable! He'd go over to their apartment tomorrow and give them a piece of his mind. And right now, his mind wasn't very peaceful. <nl> He said to the kid, ""And why aren't you there watching them? The 'hottest' hero and villain pairing in the city. That no other duo -- no matter their long and incredibly exciting history -- can match, apparently."" <nl> The kid shrugged. ""Don't like superheroes anymore. Seen it all before."" <nl> Silk sighed and released his hold on Martin. ""I'm starting to feel the same way."" <nl> Martin, for some reason, was grinning.  He placed his arm around Silk's shoulders. ""Ah, shit happens, pal. Don't let it get to you."" <nl> ""Shit does happen,"" he agreed. ""It truly does."" <nl> ""Come on, I'll buy the pizza."" <eos>

I'm being held against my will in the Nefaro Tower. Please hurry! <nl> > Love, <nl> > Princess Ailyn <3 <nl> The wall exploded in a cloud of mortar dust. The entire building trembled. I added an extra heart before looking up from the letter. I popped it into the mailbox as I rose to my full height. <nl>I opened the drawer and found a stack of stickers that looked like wall sockets. They were a reminder of the time when I got electrocuted trying to plug in my phone. <nl><nl> ""Stop right where you are, Dr. Devious!"" said the young superhero. <nl> ""Ah... Mr...."" I cleared my throat and glanced at my cheat note. ""Ah, Mr. Teen Speed! You've made a grave mistake, stumbling into my little abode!"" <nl> I gave him a practiced maniacal cackle. <nl> ""Tell me where Princess Ailyn is, right now, and I'll let you walk away with nothing worse than a few bruises."" The masked boy puffed out his chest. ""I'm going to count to three. One..."" <nl> ""Hah! That's the best you got? Preschool maths!?"" <nl> The hero grumbled and stopped counting. In a flash he blazed across the room, grabbing me from behind. I struggled a little, just enough to make it convincing. <nl> ""Arrgh! It seems you have me bested..."" I grunted, putting on a strained face. ""I knew you were powerful... uh, Teen Speed, but I had no idea just how!"" <nl> ""That's right, Dr. Devious! Now, hand her over."" <nl> At that very moment, the door to my office opened and Ailyn trotted in, carrying the sandwich with extra salami that I had asked for. Her happy grin melted away. Her dark eyes narrowed, and she looked at me sideways. <nl> ""Okay, listen to me really closely,"" I whispered in the hero's ear. ""Before you touch her, check her clothes for concealed weapons and explosives. And whatever you do, don't look her in the eyes... and make sure you wash your hands after you're done rescuing her... and also make sure you take her really far away... and if she asks you to wear a kryptonite ring, refuse... and hmm... don't give her your real identity or social security number... I mean, I shouldn't have to tell you this, but just the other week-"" <nl> ""Shut up, you snake,"" the hero said and pushed me to the ground. <nl> He blazed over to Ailyn, who now brandished a worried frown and a trembling lip. Fake, of course, but Teen Speed didn't seem to notice. He smiled broadly and lifted her off the ground. She giggled childishly and put her arms around his neck. <nl> ""Thank you for saving me!"" she said, blushing deeply. ""How will I ever repay you?"" <nl> ""Don't worry, darling, it's my job."" <nl> ""Aww! You're so brave! At least, let me give you this small token of my appreciation."" She pouted her lips. <nl> ""Noooo! Don't!"" I cried, but it was already too late. <nl> The kiss drained the hero's face of color, he frothed at the mouth and then fell into a twitching heap on the floor. <nl> ""We make such a good team!"" Ailyn stepped over his body and helped me up. ""You should've told me he was coming, it was just sheer luck that I had my poisonous lipstick on."" <nl> I rolled my eyes and returned to my desk. I started composing another letter for help. Forging her handwriting had become second nature to me, and I meant every word in every letter. <nl> ""Bury him in the backyard with the others,"" I mumbled. <nl> ""Yes, honey!"" <nl> She started dragging the body across the floor, which was no easy task for her, but one that she happily did for me. <nl> ""Oh, by the way,"" she said, huffing, ""look in the top drawer. I think you'll like it, I came up with the idea myself."" <nl> Reluctantly, I reached under the table and pulled out a stack of stickers. ""What are they?"" <nl> ""It's stickers that look like wall sockets! Let's take a trip to the airport tomorrow."" <nl> I felt the muscles in my jaw clench. I shook my head in disbelief, feeling nauseous. Someone had to come save me from her, and soon! <nl> *** <nl> r/Lilwa_Dexel for more! <eos>

His monocle sheathed the light from one of them, but didn't hide the one from the opal in the other. <nl> ""Right,"" I said. This was going to be easy. So ridiculously easy. Amazingly easy. Possibly the greatest trick that I, Murray, Djinn extraordinaire would pull. <nl> ""So we're agreed to the terms?"" The man repeated. One more time. ""That you will not use this wish to harm me in anyway?"" <nl> ""Of course, obviously,"" I said. I'd read them over myself. There wasn't a single thing he could do to me, and a hell of a lot of things I could do to him. There were so many things in this world that weren't classified as harm. Fucking idiot had picked the wrong genie to pull this shit on. <nl> ""Then I wish that the contents of this contract are satisfied,"" The man said, tapping the sheet appropriately. <nl> I snapped my fingers, my eyes closed. It was already time to get back to relaxing- I was thinking a plane ticket to southern New Mexico, spend some time among the irradiated sandy wastes of the last war. Or or maybe I could find another genie, and we could get into a wishing competition. I still had the frequent flier miles from my last wish burning a hole in my back pocket after all. <nl> The wish granted and- <nl> I paused, eyes opening, when I did not slide smoothly back into my vessel of choice, and rather remained sitting there. <nl> ""Thank you for your services,"" the man said, bowing his head slightly. ""But I think you should be aware of how I tricked you."" <nl> I stared. ""Tricked me? Come on, you can't be serious. I enforced the whims of the contract. The contract we both went over, in excruciating detail. I've been here over a week, reading every single line of this stupid thing. You can't possibly be stupid enough to think-"" <nl> ""Acrostics,"" he said. <nl> ""What the fuck is an acrostic?"" I asked. <nl> The man gestured at the edge of the contract, and then at the first letter of each word on the left hand side. ""It's part of the contents. Which I wished would be enforced. Alongside a vow that you would not hurt me."" <nl> I stared, cocking my head to the side. Ephemeral as ever, I leaned in to read the fine print. What the hell? <nl> ""The contractual agreement between Maya and Milford LLC will go through?"" I asked, clueless. ""What does that even mean?"" <nl> ""Maya, if you recall, is the name of your union,"" the man said, lazily. ""The union of djinn, to be precise."" <nl> ""I haven't paid my dues in years,"" I said. ""And what agreement?"" <nl> ""Regarding your employment."" <nl>That the contractual agreement between Maya and Milford LLC will go through,"" I asked, clueless.

I haven't been in that place for ages!"" <nl> ""A shame, as you're now the representative for my corporation for the union,"" the man gestured dismissively. One finely kept finger pressed the monocle firmly back into the socket. ""I do hope you weren't planning anything important, you're due for orientation in..."" <nl> He looked down at his watch, a finely built thing, probably from whatever ruined houses were left out of the alps. There weren't too many of those left, if I was being honest, especially since Djinn warfare hadn't been outlawed yet. ""In about five minutes."" <nl> ""Five minutes?"" I asked, clueless. <nl> ""Five minutes,"" he agreed. ""I'd get over to HR immediately."" <nl> ""HR?!"" I squeaked. ""I didn't-"" <nl> ""You did,"" The man said. ""It'll be a pleasure working together. The boss has been wanting a bit of diversity among the workforce for quite some time, and the Office of Magical Accountability has quite the bounty on your head."" <nl> It was at this point that I went desperate, and moved to the window. There was only one test left. If he had power over me, I wouldn't be able to- <nl> ""Recall to your flask, Djinn,"" The man said. ""I will take you in myself."" <nl> I threw myself out the window. It shattered, like one of those action movies I'd been meaning to catch up on between clients in the freelance business, and I was falling through it, and I was free, free free- <nl> and the trailing edge of my amorphous form caught in my flask (I'd picked it out myself from the wreckage of my time in the pacific fleets) and sucked me back inside. <nl> The man peered down into the bottle, his opal eye still locked onto my form.

"There is one major continuity error, a lapse in the self-consistency of the narrative, in the story provided. Count the number of '<nl>' in the story that occurs before the continuity error. Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> ""They say humans are the most deadly race in the universe, but she sure doesn't look like much does she, Captain?"", Xint asked as we observed our recently acquired captive. Humans were a relatively new player to the interstellar board game and not much was known about them. Hell, this is the first human that anyone on our ship has ever seen and we get around to most of the dark corners of the empire. <nl> ""As long as she sits in the corner and keeps crying like that, it works for me. Makes it easier if she doesn't even try to resist."", I mutter to Xint. <nl> The actual capture went extremely smoothly. We found her all alone on a corner of one of their outposts. A quick dart filled with some gloxylin knocked her out and we brought her on board quicker than you can say 'easy money'. She did seem to wake up quicker than anticipated, but she was safely in the cell, so it was of no consequence. <nl> ""Well Xint, you are up. We brought you on as the human expert and you said the human will need water in order to survive the journey. Go give her some."", I order. Xint leaves the observation room and retrieves the water before heading inside of the cell. As I watch the human stand up, her face still sniffling as water and other fluids leak from her orifices, I am struck by how unimpressive humans really are compared to other races. She is barely the same height as Xint and he isn't exactly tall for his race. Her limbs and body seem to be relatively weak. No overt musculature, no sharp claws, no poison sacs, no electrified glands, nothing... How these creatures are dangerous is beyond me. A yell brings my attention back to the cell. <nl>That specific rapid fire cracking grouping of sounds will never leave my nightmares...  And I realize that I never got around to cleaning off my third stomach after throwing up earlier.""<nl><nl> ""What do you mean you can't let me go?"", screams the human. <nl> Xint recoils for a split second before he gets some nerve and stands up proudly on his six legs. ""You are now a slave of Emperor Krenacht. He requested to have a human in his retinue. You should really be quite pleased, serving the Emperor directly is a great honor!"", Xint finishes saying while offering her the small container of water. <nl> At the mention of the word slave, the human's eyes open wide and her entire body pulls in and she takes a step away from Xint. She looks even smaller now than she did before, somehow even less dangerous. As Xint's main motor limb brings the water towards the human, she explodes into action. Her right hand swings out and slaps at the water container, sending it slamming into the viewing window that I am using. My eyes open wide as I realize that the front half of Xint's motor limb is still holding the container and his eyes stare at the missing section of his limb. <nl> A loud keening wail of pain starts to leave Xint, but it is quickly silenced by the human. ""LET ME GO!"", she screams as she brings her hands up and pushes hard against my fellow shipmen. I have never seen one of our kind be crushed by hand as effectively as poor Xint. His body slammed into the wall, the loud crack of his hardened carapace signaling that he would not be living through this without immediate medical attention. The human stood there breathing heavily, even more water streaming down her face. She seems poised, waiting for something. I don't realize what it is until too late. Xint feebly attempts to cry for help and the moment he makes an auditory sound, she pounces on him. <nl> I thought that her upper limbs had strength, but they were far inferior to her lower two limbs. Every time that she reared back and brought one of her feet forward in a vicious strike, I could hear the sounds of her foot breaking through his front carapace, her foot exiting his rear carapace, and her foot smashing into the wall of the cell. That specific rapid fire cracking grouping of sounds will never leave my nightmares... <nl> It only took a few seconds for her to collapse there, right on Xint's body. She was covered in the pink color of Xint's internal fluids and she resumed crying almost immediately. Barely thirty seconds had passed since Xint entered the cell and I was still standing there with a blank stare, my mind trying to make sense of what I had just seen. <nl> The electronic chirp of my communication device finally brought me back to reality and I found myself immediately vacating the contents of two of my three stomachs. I hastily activate my communicator while cleaning myself off. <nl> ""What is it?"" <nl> ""Captain, we are being hailed by a human ship. They say that we have one of their race on board and they are demanding we release her immediately."" <nl> ""Tell them that we don't have any such creature on board and it is a violation of reg-"" <nl> ""Captain, they launched something towards us. Scans say that it has no weaponized potential. If I didn't know any better I would say it is a small lifepod of some sort."" <nl> Before I could even formulate a thought as to what the humans were doing, the sound of the lifepod slamming into the hull reverberates throughout the ship. I stand there, in the observation room, watching with wide eyes as something begins to cut a hole in the ceiling of the cell. The hole is maybe three times as wide as the human. The circle of hull plating crashes to the floor of the cell, further crushing two of Xint's legs. Out of the hole descends something that will stick with me forever. Another human, this one easily twice as tall as the human we had captured, drops to the deck and looks in a slow circle. He finally sees our captive and he drops to a crouch and holds his upper limbs out wide. <nl> ""Daddy!!!!"", the captive screams as she launches herself at the larger creature with a force that would have knocked me across an entire compartment. The larger human wraps his upper limbs around her and stands back up, muttering small words of assurance the entire way. <nl> He looks over towards the viewing window that I am using and I immediately know true fear. What I now know to be his progeny looks up at him and smiles through the water coming down her face. Then she slowly licks the internal fluids of Xint off of her finger and her eyes brighten up. ""Daddy, they taste like strawberry!"" <eos>

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> I spiraled through the air as I plummeted towards the concrete below me. This was my favorite thing in the world to do, and trust me, I had done it all. The thrill of it never faded, and it made me feel something that faintly resembled happiness, even though I knew I hadn't felt that for thousands of years. I knew it wouldn't kill me, but it was something to do, and it's not like I had places to be. <nl> ****** <nl> I could think so clearly while I was falling, could reminisce on all the lives I had lived. I remembered the demonic creature that had cursed me all those years ago, had given me a choice that seemed, at the time, too good to be true. <nl> *""I can grant you what no other creature on this world has ever had. Something that no creature on this world ever will have. True freedom from death. True freedom from feeling. You will be a god of time itself.""* <nl> For the first few million years, it was amazing. Nothing could hurt me, nothing could even cause me pain, and when you've been around for as long as I have, time moves much faster. The first 46 million years flew by, but no other creature really resembled me, so I spent most of my time to myself. It was only a few hundred thousand years ago that a branch of these creatures started to resemble me, and I found myself drawn and attracted to the creatures. But I quickly learned that the world was still way too hostile, and life too short, so I decided to hold off on beginning any sort of life with these creatures until death wasn't so imminent for them. Three times I started a family. Three times I watched my family die without me. I couldn't feel physical pain, but mental pain...that existed. It was almost as if my mind became more active and sensitive to my thoughts since the physical component of the world was stripped away from it. <nl>The man had explained how they would ""freeze"" terminally ill people with the intent of ""unfreezing"" them when the cure for their disease had been found in the future. This was our way out. We couldn't kill ourselves, but we could shut our minds off. No more suffering. <nl> But little did I know, my mind would be more active and sensitive than ever in the confines of the capsule, the suffering only intensifying.<nl><nl> And it was taking its toll. I wanted it all to stop. The thoughts, the pain, *the guilt.* But death always alluded me, and I gave up. On life. On death. On everything. <nl> ***** <nl> I slammed into the concrete. My body ricocheted off of it like it was nothing, and I got up to my feet to brush off the dust from my trench coat. *3 AM.* Perfect time to pull these jumps. I didn't want to scare or frighten anyone; I had caused enough suffering in this world. I started walking back towards my apartment. <nl> ""You too, huh?"" I whipped around to see a man standing in front of me with a solemn look on his face. ""Can't even count how many times I've tried that,"" the man muttered with a half-hearted chuckle. <nl> ""Yo....You...You're immortal too?"" <nl> ""Yeah, there's a ton of us around now. The devil likes to watch us suffer, it amuses him..."" <nl> ""I'm so...so tired. I just want it to end. All of it. The thoughts are overwhelming."" I could feel my body trembling as I spoke to the man. *Finally someone who could relate.* <nl> ""Trust me man, I want it all to end, too. I used to think death was the worst thing that could happen to someone, but let me tell you, death ain't shit compared to this."" I nodded my head in silent concurrence. ""But I think I found a way to get us out of this hell."" <nl> My ears propped up as I listened to what I hoped would be the first bit of good news I had heard in hundreds of years. <nl> ***** <nl> The tranquilizers barely affected us, but they were enough to convince the doctors that we were dead. We had become the masters of our own bodies throughout the years, and with the help of these horse tranquilizers, we could feign death very easily. <nl> As I lay in the capsule they put me in, I could barely hold in my excitement. It was finally going to be all over. *Don't smile, don't smile* I thought to myself as the vitrification process began. <nl> The man had explained how they would ""freeze"" terminally ill people with the intent of ""unfreezing"" them when the cure for their disease had been found in the future. This was our way out. We couldn't kill ourselves, but we could shut our minds off. No more suffering. <nl> ****** <nl> I waited in silent excitement as the men in front of me set things up for slumber. I could hear them shuffling around in front of me. Any second now, I'd go under. The shuffling continued. Then it got fainter. And fainter. I pried my eyes open to see the technicians walking away from my capsule. *They were finished.* It didn't work. Not even this could shut our minds off. <nl> But the true horror of my situation only gradually set in. I couldn't move, I couldn't speak, I couldn't hear, I could *barely* see. My mind let out a silent scream as I realized that I would be spending eternity in this capsule under the ground... <nl> Edit: Formatting. <eos>

Any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated!! <nl> It was quiet, the only sounds a faint hum coming from the emergency overhead lighting, and a steady click as the ship rotated. Gravity was steady, the screens along the wall calculated and compensated fully automatically, and oxygen was flowing. I closed the maintenance panel and latched it shut; everything was in order. Of course it was, the *Ranger* had been fault free since its launch two hundred years ago. I honestly don't know why I still checked, the system would alert me to any malfunctions within nanoseconds. <nl> I moved down the hallway, casting a brief glance into the long-unused galley. Cans of freeze dried food sat in the cabinets, uneaten and unspoiled, but I stopped eating and drinking years ago. I couldn't even remember how long it'd been since I last tasted anything; decades? It didn't matter now. I continued my shuffle, towards the main bay. The glass ceiling and walls here looked out onto a vast, black expanse. Light from distant stars taunted me with every twinkle, but I was immune to that now too. I was immune to everything... <nl>It was me, alone in the vast expanse of space, with only my thoughts and memories to keep me company. Every day was the same, every routine the same, every meal the same freeze-dried slop. But one thing was different. I could hear her voice, clear as a bell, calling my name in the silence. I shook my head, trying to clear the hallucination. It was impossible. She was gone. <nl><nl> The console at my station showed the *Ranger's* current position, but we were so far away from anything that I was nothing more than a pixel in the center of a void. I'd lost everything, and all I had to show for progress was a steadily increasing number in the corner of a panel, showing the many hundreds of millions of miles from Earth that I was. The distance I was from her.. It didn't matter now, she'd been dead so long I doubted her grave was even still marked; it along with everything else probably been covered by the dust a century ago. I toyed with the chain in my pocket briefly, but removed my hand and turned my attention to the ship's life support systems. Stable, as always.  Everything had gone into this ship, the culmination of seventy five years of human cooperation. It was all we had left as a race, and I was the Caretaker. The ship could maintain a course, repair and sustain its own systems, and store the vast database of human knowledge that had been entered into its database. By all accounts, it was perfect. If only I had been. <nl> I couldn't get her face out of my head, though. The dying sunlight glistening in the tears on her face, the slowing heartbeat I felt in her chest.. And her voice, echoing endlessly in my ears. ""Promise me."" she had said. It wasn't a request, it was a command, one that carried the weight of a dying mother.""Promise me you'll live. Promise me, that no matter what, you will see this through."" I had nodded, a simple, silent affirmation that I'd do what she asked. Only then had she handed me the tray; six, small embryos, frozen in saline and sealed to the outside world. On top of the tray, she placed a silver chain; it had once held a locket with our daughter's name on it, but even that was lost. ""Do it for her, don't fail us..You're not allowed to die too, okay?"" I had promised her, and somehow, inexplicably, I'd kept that promise. I was alive, and God only knows I tried so hard not to be. <nl> I closed my eyes and squeezed, trying to remove the image from my mind. Two hundred years, and I saw her face every day. I turned to the cold chamber entrance, now open as it had been for seventy five years. You see, by all accounts the ship was perfect, but only in that every program still ran smoothly, perfectly. I, on the other hand, was imperfect; a Caretaker for the last six chances for us as humans to continue to live. And after one hundred twenty five years, I made a mistake. Just one; but by leaving that door open, I had doomed everything.. <nl> *Edit: Formatting <eos>

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> My time in the army would be considered a failure by most reasonable standards.  I never really had it in me to be a fighter, and the attempt to ""game-ify"" didn't exactly fix things because gore in games made me sick too.  I wasn't dishonorably discharged and I didn't go AWOL, but I sure wasn't the shining beacon of hope they think a soldier should be.  I did my duty, and that was it. <nl> I dunno if the implants were supposed to come out or not, but they didn't, and I wasn't bothering to have them removed.  At first I found them annoying, but it's the sort of thing that grows on you. <nl> The weapons display is mostly useless.  I mean, I can gauge the relative damage that could be dealt by a stab or throw with various pens I own.  And that part of the HUD turns green when I hold a steak knife.  But it does help me remember to go to the gym, because I can see the power of a punch slowly dropping the less in shape I am. <nl> The health one is surprisingly useless.  How physically ready I am for a fight compared to maximum doesn't really come up much.  It goes down when I'm on the toilet or in bed.  It goes up when my heart rate is up.  Again, the only real benefit is when exercising, knowing when my heart rate is up and timing it. <nl> Inventory management is nice, but non-essential.  I get to know that my keys are on me and how much money was in my wallet last I looked.  Hunger, and tiredness tell me nothing I don't already know.  And I seriously want to punch the idiot who thought that I really needed a RAGE meter.  To tell how angry I am.  Because I definitely couldn't figure that out on my own.  Oh hey there it goes again, right on cue.  Thanks rage meter, couldn't have figured that out.  You're the best. <nl> Really though, I shouldn't downplay how life-changing the implant was.  Quite possibly the best thing that ever happened to me.  And that's because of something programmed in that feels like it was almost an afterthought by the designer, the ""current mission"" info box in the corner. <nl> I don't stay focused well.  Or rather, didn't.  But the box works off my subconscious amazingly well.  Not only does it focus on my higher priorities, but if I spend a little time thinking about a problem, it will keep the breakdown of steps in order of what's necessary to complete my objective, no matter how simple.  And it prioritizes things. <nl>The implants were supposed to come out, but they didn't, and I wasn't bothering to have them removed.<nl><nl> Sounds useful?  You have no idea.  I wouldn't have my current career, wife, or house without it.  Even if I'd made it that far, I'd have likely burned myself out at my job without it.  If I compare before and after, I can easily see my former self as a homeless fool after leaving the army. <nl> I used to wonder what I'd do if someone from the R&D department came to ""fix"" me and remove this system that's pretty much become a part of me.  I used to, because the escape contingency plan has literally been finalized for a decade, though it occasionally gets a tweak or two.  I probably won't need it, but as I learned long ago, it pays to be prepared, and know what your priorities are. <eos>

Story: <sos> ""Go ahead, boy,"" Dan said to his dog, Rocket. <nl> Rocket peered at the towering gold gateway in front of them. Clouds swirled overhead, the ground was a blanket of wooly velvet. Murmers and barks could be heard far off, beyond the gates. <nl> A large pale dog trainer, with golden hair and white robe held a silver, heavenly dog leash. The heavenly trainer held the collar of the leash out lovingly, beckoning Rocket. <nl> Rocket glanced at the collar, then back at Dan, unsure. He ran over to Dan and licked his face. The trainer stared at Dan knowingly, then nodded its head. He heard a voice in his head. *I see. Go, then. You may return soon.* <nl> Rocket wagged his tail, licking Dan's face and growling affectionately. The trainer waved as they left the gateway entrance. <nl> They walked down a silver staircase deep into the ground. Or was it a ceiling? Dan could not be sure. <nl> Dan followed the staircase deep into the depths of the structure. He held a handrail as he descended, watching Rocket as he trailed behind. <nl> From the air, out of nowhere, apparitions appeared. They had faces of grim death. One was a skeletal face, a snake weaving through its eye sockets. It spoke to Dan: <nl> *That one does not belong here. Leave it. Come with me if you want to be saved.* <nl> Dan looked at Rocket, and Rocket gave no indication of leaving or stopping. Dan shook his head at the apparition. ""No,"" said Dan, ""he comes with me."" <nl> The apparition exploded into a red fireball and disappeared into the tunnel before him. Dan had reached a long corridor. At the end he heard screams. Bloodcurtling bellowing of men and women who were lost to the world. <nl> Dan knew he did not belong here. But it was the only way. And Rocket pushed him to continue. <nl> They moved down the corridor slowly, as the screaming grew louder. The walls seemed to shake, like when you go to a loud concert. That was what it sounded like to Dan, a loud rock concert of death. <nl> Rocket groaned, but they had come too far to turn back. <nl> They came upon a tall black door. A door as grim as hell. On the surface was a protruding eye. The eye opened and looked at Dan. It blinked a few times, then closed. Then the door swung open, and Dan and Rocket were met with a blast of hellish screams. <nl> The place was a spectacle. Humans being torn apart then put back together again, only to be torn apart once again. People on a spit, being roasted, eaten alive, then built back into full beings. Some people just cried in a fetal position. <nl> In the center of this huge arena-like place, was a tall tower. It had a glowing eye on top that seemed to oppressively watch all that transpired below. <nl> Rocket barked at the tower, and stood in front of Dan protectively. Dan patted Rocket on the head. ""Its OK boy. They're just lost souls. We're not lost, we're on our way through."" <nl> Rocket licked his hand, and they started to go through the arena, toward the tower. Large demons with scarred, tragic faces beckoned them to their torture areas. Dan tried to shield his eyes, to ignore the protests of the hungry wraiths. The demons of purgatory were hungry for young blood. They seemed to be attracted to Dan like a magnet. <nl> But Rocket growled and barked at the demons and devils as they approached, scaring them away. ""Good boy,"" Dan said. <nl> As they got closer to the great tower with the eye, a dark cloaked being appeared from behind. <nl> ""You do not belong in this realm,"" the being said. <nl> ""Who are you?"" asked Dan. <nl> ""I am the keeper. I make sure people suffer in due course. I know the eyes of the guilty. Your eyes betray an innocence that transcends any purgatory. You have the look of an innocent. The are only two ways to go, up and down. Otherwise you stay in the middle, which is not where you belong."" <nl> Dan shook his head in confusion, then pet Rocket. ""Let's go boy, these people are crazy."" <nl>Dan stood in front of the gateway. Nothing happened. He waited, fearful that he would be stuck here forever, waiting.""#14
""Oh, I see. You can't handle the truth, can you?!<nl><nl> They continued their journey to the tower, stepping over dead bodies and severed limbs. The ground was caked with dry blood. The blood stuck to Dan's soles, leaving footsteps the color of wine behind him. <nl> They eventually reached the foot of the tower, then looked up at the eye. It beamed down at them. Searching. Scrutinizing. <nl> It appeared to be satisfied with Dan in some way. A doorway opened up in front of them. Dan and Rocket shrugged and walked through the door. <nl> Inside it was like a very old elevator. Like the type they have in bygone towers in New York City. Dan recalled a trip to the Big Apple when he was just a little lad. They brought him up to the top of the Empire State Building. When he went to the platform, he looked over the ledge, and dropped a penny. He was terrified it would fall on an innocent person's head and slice through their skull. <nl> He shuddered at that thought, and hoped it would not betray him in this place. <nl> Up the elevator went, seemingly forever. Just when he thought the ride would never end, they reached a top floor, and heard a *ding*. <nl> The doors slid open, and they were hit with a blast of heavenly white light. They heard choirs singing, bells chiming. There was a rainbow shimmer to the air. A dove flew over, and Rocket chased after it. <nl> Dan glanced at the dog chasing the bird, and laughed. <nl> Then he saw a giant gateway. It was towering, monumental, encrusted with jewels. He stepped up to it, staring up at the parapets above. It was a sort of castle, but the walls never seemed to end. Sort of like the great wall of china, but spectacularly stunning in form. <nl> Dan stood in front of the gateway. Nothing happened. He waited, fearful that he would be stuck here forever, waiting. <nl> Then a being made of light hovered down beside Dan. It had angel wings and carried a sword and shield. <nl> ""Why do you have weapons?"" asked Dan. <nl> ""To guard against any invaders. Heaven is a place of protection."" The angel glanced over at Rocket. ""That is your animal. He has been your companion to this place."" <nl> Dan nodded. <nl> ""We welcome both of you to our home. Your home. Please enter, and be at peace,"" said the angel. <nl> Dan called Rocket, but when he looked over, rocket had changed. Rocket was a ghost now. A glowing, shimmering spirit. He gave a small bark, and licked Dan. <nl> When Dan looked at himself, he saw that he too was now a shimmering spirit. He touched Rocket, and felt the warmth of his soul pulsating within him. <nl> ""You can feel each other's thoughts now,"" said the angel. <nl> Dan felt Rocket's thoughts. Pure love, that only a dog can produce. Rocket's eyes glowed, and seemed to cry with joy. <nl> ""This is a good place,"" said Dan. <nl> ""The best,"" said Rocket. <nl> Dan smiled. He loved happy endings. <eos>

Story: <sos> The vWall in my apartment flickered to life, a flash immediately appearing to signal an emergency bulletin. <nl> I stopped gumming my sandwich long enough to hit the mute button before that fucking baby President Burris started talking. They all looked like babies to me. It'd been long enough that I couldn't remember being that young, feeling that young. It made it hard to empathize with all of the pomp and circumstance of the office of the presidency when a kid was gabbing at you. <nl> Was I bitter? Sure. Maybe a little. But still. Fucking babies. <nl> I heard he was on the high end of pill\-kids. Maybe only a few years younger than me, though he didn't look it. I watched him for a few moments, taking a bit of amusement in the pulsing vein in his forehead while my finger hovered over the unmute button. He was looking particularly distressed today. Must be hard having everlasting life. <nl> Probably an update on that volcano rolling through Hawaii for the last sixty years. Heaven to hell in under a century. <nl> A chiron scrolled across the bottom, blaring ""EMERGENCY: VITA26 DEFECTS."" <nl> Well, that was new. My finger pressed the unmute and I took a bite of my ham and cheese as Burris squeaky kid voice emitted from the vWall. <nl> ""\-\-drastic ramifications for the health of our society. We currently have no estimation on what it will take to rectify the situation as all genetic manipulations have become inert in V26 takers."" <nl> My jaw slowly hung open, a half ground piece of ham plopping out onto my plate. What was that? I wave my hand in front of the vWall, rewinding the message by a minute. <nl>What the hell was he going on about? What critical side effect? <nl> ""We have tried a vast cross section of remedies with no solutions in sight. Clearly, this has drastic ramifications for the Department of Health. We currently have no estimation on what it will take to rectify the situation as all genetic manipulations have become inert in V26 takers.<nl><nl> ""Current studies produced by our Department of Health, the United Nations and the Chinese Ministry of People have all reached the same conclusion: V26 has a detrimental side effect.

We currently have no estimation on what it will take to rectify the situation as all genetic manipulations have become inert in V26 takers."" <nl> Ok, I got that part, which was alarming in and of itself. Gene\-therapy, ever since CRISPR has been the hallmark of modern civilization. I was old, but I wasn't dying. I had another thirty or forty left in me thanks to gene therapy. <nl> ""To repeat, people exhibiting the symptoms of V26 degradation are to be considered EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. If you see someone exhibiting these signs, you are to call the number appearing on your screen."" <nl> Burris was reduced to a small picture\-in\-picture in the corner, with a large graphic appearing. On top there was a CDC number for those showing V26 Syndrome. Below, the symptoms were listed out. <nl> *Deterioration in higher mental reasoning.* <nl> *Deterioration in physical coordination.* <nl> *Extreme violence.* <nl> *Cannibalism.* <nl> Fucking cannibalism? This shit got real in a hurry. Wait a second. My eyes scanned down through the list of symptoms again.

The stress of the alert had shaken me to the point where I was imagining things. Twenty-eight minutes to impact, the announcer had said. Could that even be possible? How could they be so sure? I tried yet again to make a call but the phone network was down. No calls, no data. <nl> 'Hey ASSHOLE,' said a loud, irritated voice. Not a voice I knew. I looked around the room. Saw nothing. No-one. <nl> Caught Bozo's eye again somehow. <nl> 'YES IT'S ME,' he bark-shouted. He had a strange voice, not quite human. But not bad, all things considered, for a dog. <nl> 'Twenty-seven minutes left,' he said. 'Let's get moving.' <nl> 'But... where?' I said. 'The TV said to stay - ' <nl> 'No time,' he said. 'Just come. Or I'm going to bite you right in the fucking nuts, OK?' <nl> I nodded. <nl> 'No baggage. Only speed matters. Let's go!' <nl> Next thing I knew I was following him out the back door and through the side gate. I had expected the streets to be packed with cars, but it seemed everyone else was taking the warning to stay indoors seriously. Looking at the outwardly still and calm houses, I wondered if people out there had fallout shelters, duck and cover, that sort of thing. It seemed very unlikely. <nl> 'Come ON,' bark-ordered Bozo. <nl> I remembered that anything was possible. <nl> I ran after him, but the pace was too fast. <nl> 'Can't,' I wheezed. 'Too much... Hills...' <nl>'But... How? How are you talking? Why did you never talk before?'<nl><nl> Then he was behind me, snapping at my heels. I yelped. He laughed. I upped my speed. My chest felt like it was about to rip open and whatever was in there would just flop out onto the ground. I could hear a strange mingling of laughing and barking behind me. <nl> 'I've been waiting for this day,' Bozo said gleefully. 'I told you you should have walked me more. Move it! Run!' <nl> At a point deep into the woods what felt like an eternity later, Bozo shouted to stop. I collapsed on the ground. I was honestly not sure if I would rather die at that moment, or in a few minutes when the impact happened. I didn't see what the damn dog was up to, and then I heard a grinding sound. A heavy concrete door in the forest floor had opened up. <nl> 'Inside, quick,' Bozo said. 'Only two minutes left.' <nl> I hauled myself up and went half-way down a set of stairs that led into darkness. I looked back to find Bozo still standing at the top looking down at me. <nl> 'Aren't you coming?' I asked. <nl> 'No,' he said. 'I don't need it. You're on your own from here.' <nl> 'But... How? How are you talking? Why did you never talk before?' <nl> 'Isn't it obvious?' <nl> 'This is a dream?' <nl> He bark-laughed what I felt was a bit nastily. 'I'm from the future. Sent here by your descendants. Covering most of the timelines, in fact. They seem to have done quite a bit better than you. Financially, I mean.' <nl> 'Oh,' I said. That seemed good, in some ways. <nl> Then I asked: 'Will I see you again?' <nl> 'Afraid not,' he said. 'But, um, good luck.' <nl> The door started to close. <nl> Just before it did, I saw his face one last time. <nl> 'I've always fucking hated the name Bozo, by the way,' he said. <nl> Then he was gone and the door slammed shut. I was alone in complete, silent darkness. <eos>

Oh, looks like we've got one.  'Ere we have the rare basilisk. Crikey, this ones a giant in'it he? Now the thing you've got to remember with basilisks is, if they stare you straight in the eye, yer turned to solid rock. So the best thing to do with these is to wear a blindfold 'round ya head. Now that I've got mine on, I can start to wrangle it. <nl> Whatcha wannado with these critters is get low to the ground while you approach em. Now they're going to- oof, yea- to try and rear up at ya. Once you hear that screech you've got to go in at em. Grab em right- c'mon there ya go- right here, right under the front two legs. Keep your head Low, it'll try and nip ya, but it can't bend its neck far enough. <nl> Shh, shh, calm girl calm. Now we can safely remove the blindfold, as we keep her eyes pointed safely in the sky. Ya can see this ones a girl cause of the crystal 'tween her eyes. Males don't got that 'tween their eyes, just real thick, thick, eyebrow ridges. As a secondary weapon the basilisk has these thick claws, take a look 'ere. Each ones about a quarter inch thick and hard as granite. Teeth too, once bit straight through my sternum. Lucky I'm dead else it've put me out of commission. <nl> Alright, time to let her go now. You've got to put your blindfold back on and toss her back quick. I'm going to push off in 3.....2......1....go go go go, alright c'mon. Looks like shes stopped following now and- wassat? Zoom in over there. Crickey, shes got a little runt with her. Definitely the smallest of her litter, little guy must only be about a foot long. S'allright to look at 'im. Poor lil guy wont open his eyes for 'nother month at least. For now he's sticking close to mommy for protection. The young climb on their mothers back for protection from threats. For the first three months of their lives they're effectively defenseless against predators, specially weasels. <nl> God. That's just absolutely beautiful. Watching mother and son go into the sunset together. Nature's majesty right before us. Thanks all for tuning in, catch me here next week when we go after the elusive jackalope, the mirage of the midwest. G'night! <eos>

Story: <sos> Lucifer advanced upon Hesperus, who had stolen his fiddle again and was balanced on a tower of carcasses in an abandoned corner of Hell, playing defiantly. *That* music. The harmonies alone put his teeth on edge. <nl> ""Stop that! I will shove this down your throat next time,"" he said, grabbing the fiddle from Hes's hands. ""How many times must I tell you? Do I have to engrain the message on your forehead for you to remember? I can do that, you know. I will not allow that music here!"" <nl> Tears sprang into Hes's eyes, to Lucifer's despair and disgust. The kid was just like his mother. So appallingly *human*. One would think his genes would have balanced it out, but apparently not. <nl> ""I hate you!"" Hes screamed, scrambling down from the pile of bones. <nl> Lucifer felt a surge of hope. That was more like it. <nl> ""Great,"" he said, slapping his half-human son on the shoulder. ""Listen, why don't you go take out all your rage on a few souls? Indulge yourself a little. I've just got some new hooks and cleavers in, real cutting edge stuff - "" <nl> ""No,"" Hes said. His eyes were wide and terrified, but he stood his ground. ""I want to go play music. On Earth. *My* music. I want to make people happy, give them hope - if you won't allow it here, I'll take it somewhere people will appreciate me!"" <nl> Not this again. Lucifer looked at his son, and saw how *wrong* he was. All soft edges and human kindness. Fifteen years raised in Hell hadn't produced even a single hint of demonic power. No bouts of rage and cruelty, no aspirations for power. Nothing to indicate that he was ready to take over the reins from his father when the time came. In fact, he cringed away from violence, frequently bursting into tears or vomiting at the sight of torture. It was embarrassing. <nl> He didn't know how it was possible. His genes *should* have influenced the boy, but there was nothing. How long could this 'peace and love' phase last, anyway? More and more, he regretted stealing Hes from the human hospital all those years ago. <nl> He could punish the boy. Perhaps tear his fingers apart, that would be amusing. He'd never touch a fiddle after that. But it was so much effort, and would likely only end in the boy's sanity snapping. Hes had never been strong. <nl> He was just tired of bothering. <nl> ""Go, then,"" Lucifer said, turning his back on the kid and walking away. ""Go crawl to your mother. You can even take the fiddle. Stay there and rot. You'll see - Earth is far from the paradise of peace you think it is. See how much humans need another worthless musician peddling *love*."" <nl> ---------- <nl>I know you're a good kid deep down, don't be this way...be better..."" <nl><nl> Hes walked up the street, approaching the house slowly as the sun set over Earth. His father had done one thing before tossing him from Hell: he'd at least given him an address. <nl> He knocked, clutching the fiddle tightly. Would his mother even recognise him? <nl> A sullen-faced teenager opened the door and looked Hes up and down. ""What?"" <nl> ""I'm - uhm, looking for Alison Wreath?"" Hes asked, stammering slightly as the human stared at him, expressionless. <nl> The boy narrowed his hazel eyes - in the dying light of the day, they looked almost yellow. ""Nope, sorry, she doesn't live here."" <nl> He slammed the door. <nl> Hes turned and walked away, tears prickling his eyes. All lies - it was just like dad. To give him hope, only to crush it. He probably wanted him to die homeless on the streets, just to prove a point. And then rip him to shreds when he arrived in Hell, again. <nl> The boy in the house watched from the window as the kid with the fiddle walked away, wondering idly what *that* had been about. <nl> ""Someone here to see you, mom,"" he said, turning around and grinning at the corpse on the ground. Her eyes bulged out as she stared at him, her mouth still fixed in a scream. <nl> He sighed, horrified to find himself bored in the silence of the house. He'd killed her to achieve it, he couldn't be bored again yet. <nl> But it was kind of nice not to hear that constant whining in his ear. The same old mysterious waffle, over and over again. The look of reproach and horror in her eyes, the constant tears at what he did. <nl> *Don't be like this, sweetie, I gave up everything for you. If you only knew what I did, what I sacrificed. I saved you. I know you're a good kid deep down, don't be this way...be better...* <nl> He knew he was probably adopted, but the bitch had refused to reveal anything even as he killed her. He thought it would feel good, but he'd felt nothing. Even that had been boring, like everything in life. <nl> He glanced out of the window again. The kid with the fiddle had sat down on the street, and was playing quietly to himself. <nl> He opened the door. He should've asked the boy why he had been looking for his mom. Now that he thought about it, it was the first time he could remember someone knocking on the door, asking for her. It had always been just the two of them, constantly moving house. As if she was paranoid about being followed. He had to start putting together a map of sorts, a list of everyone his mother had known in her life. Someone, somewhere, would know who his dad was. It was the one thing that he was still curious about. <nl> He had to start asking questions somewhere. A boy with a fiddle was as good as anything. <nl> ------ <nl> Hope you liked my story!

Her finger is just centimetres away from ending me. <nl> ""Yes,"" I groan. My ribs hurt like mad. I have no idea how I am supposed to get of this mess I have gotten myself into, but I know I need to try. <nl> Helena chuckles. Hero of the people, that is what she calls herself. How she sees herself. But I know better. She walks up to me and tilts my chin upwards. For the first time in our entire history, I see her grin. <nl> ""I suppose it won't hurt,"" she says, ""seeing that you're tied up in your current state."" <nl> She pulls up a chair and sits a few steps from me. ""You never listened anyway, so maybe this is my only chance."" <nl> I breathe a sigh of relief. She took the bait. While my hands explore the lock that she placed them in, I need to keep her distracted. ""So, tell me, hero of the people, what do you have to say for yourself?"" <nl> Helena is no hero of the people, no matter what she believes. The amount of innocent lives that she took would put even Hitler to shame. She was a terrorist, simple as that. One who is committed to sow chaos and discord. I am the one who have always thwarted her plans, stopping her from achieving her goals. People call me Protector for a reason. <nl> ""Have you ever heard of Syria, Mr Protector?"" <nl> I nod my head. ""It's where you were born, isn't it?"" <nl> Interpol has briefed me before on Helena's history. They thought it would help me in my quest to stop her. It did nothing more than wasted a few hours of my life. Never once have those information, obscure as they were, helped me. I never had the time, anyway. All my time were devoted to dealing with Helena's evil plans. <nl> ""Correct. But I am sure you know what happened to the country right?"" <nl> I stay silent. Syria no longer exists. The place is nothing more than a wasteland now. Helena's gaze pierces mine. There is so much anger and hate burning in her eyes. <nl> ""You are a war refugee,"" I say. One of my fingers manages to slip pass the restraint and I am able to activate my distress signal. My team will know that I am in trouble and send help. I just need to keep Helena busy. <nl> Helena chuckles again. ""I see that your masters have taught you well. But have they ever told you about what happened after that?"" <nl> From the Interpol files, she was shown to have journeyed to Europe, like so many of her countrymen. From there on, details have been scarce. Interpol had no idea what happened during those few years, but when she re-emerged, her name was tied to a suspected bombing in France. Twenty people died. And people have never stopped dying since then. <nl> ""You became a monster,"" I whisper, which provoke a laugh from Helena. <nl>I suppose it won't hurt,"" she says, ""seeing that you're tied up in your current state.<nl><nl> ""A monster?"" She shouts. ""Is that what your masters told you? That I am a monster? I'll show you what's a monster!"" <nl> Another sharp pain pierces through my ribs. I scream in pain as a few more of my bones break. I make the extra effort to spit my blood at Helena. <nl> ""Just kill me already,"" I taunt her. Even if I die, Helena will not be able to escape like how she always does. I have already done my role in locating her. Jonas and the rest will be able to take her in, finally. <nl> Helena shakes her head. She looks at my arm, where a symbol of a shield was tattooed on it. <nl> ""I will tell you what happened to me,"" she says as she lifts her sleeves, revealing an identical tattoo to mine. <nl> ""No, it couldn't be,"" I say out loud. <nl> Helena seems to read my mind. ""Yes, Mr Protector. I have the same symbol as you. Maybe the same story as you. Let me guess, you're special, they need you to protect the world and you are destined for a higher calling?"" <nl> The sudden realisation hits me harder than Helena's earlier punches. Those were the exact words used when I was recruited. I believed every single one of them. <nl> ""You're lying!"" I scream. Helena is just toying with me, I tell myself. She is after all, the leader of the most dangerous organisation on the planet. Of course mind games would be up her alley. <nl> ""My friends will be here soon and you will have nowhere to escape!"" I continue. I will not let her get to me. I am the only one chosen to be the Protector, not her. She must have gotten the info about me, somehow. <nl> Helena smiles at me. ""I know that they are coming. My aim here today is just you. Just think about it, will you? Until we meet again."" <nl> A loud crash shakes the room and the entire area plunges into darkness. <nl> ""Helena?"" My voice echoes in the room. She is gone. <nl> -------------------- <nl> Edit: I finished Part 2!

Story: <sos> It's a tough business, working in wish-law; humans are such greedy, demanding creatures, always trying to suck every little bit of value from the Vault and into their meaningless little lives. More wealth than any one human could spend in three lifetimes, some kind of impossible superpower or immortality; basically, things that we genies can't grant. Sorry, we can't make your meaty fleshbag survive a walk on the sun. <nl> I swear, people think genies are some kind of magician and it kills me. My job is taking those impossible expectations, toning them down, and making them foolproof. After all, we genies get tired of being wish-slaves and screw with humans where we can. <nl> I've done it a few times in my day, before I was Free. <nl> But occasionally, you get a straggler, someone that wants to wish for something a bit off the typical course.

She apologized profusely, scolding the man, threatening to call security if he didn't leave. There was a fire burning in his eyes that captivated me, so I set my pen down and waved to her. <nl> ""It's okay, Regina. I'll see him."" <nl> She fired him a dirty look, then nodded to me and shut the door behind her. He took a seat before I could even offer, a rugged man, somewhat unkempt. <nl> ""I finally found myself a wish. Huge pain in the ass, but I got it,"" he said, grinning. <nl> I blinked a few times, then smiled. ""How wonderful. Is there something I can help you with?"" <nl> ""Yeah, no shit. I need to get my wish ready. You're supposedly good at that, right?"" <nl>My jaw was slightly ajar. Can you believe that shit?""<nl><nl> My jaw knotted. ""Yes, sir, that's what I do. Tell me a little bit about your situation."" <nl> ""Aite, so, my girlfriend Katja--"" <nl> I tried to stifle the laugh, but just enough slipped through for him to notice. <nl> ""Something funny, asshole?"" He raised his eyebrows. <nl> ""No, sorry sir."" <nl> ""Look, I'll take my business somewhere else. Plenty of people around making sure those wishbitches do their damn job right."" <nl> The smile on my face faded. He may have just used that term because I appeared to be human, but the man's demeanor led me to believe he'd say it to a genie's face. ""Please, sir, I apologize. Continue."" <nl> ""Well, my girlfriend left me last month. Bitch broke my VR kit just because I was flirting with some other girl. Nothing serious, just having some fun, but goddamn Katja is just so uptight. She just threw it out the window! Can you believe that shit? Women are insane."" <nl> I held back any commentary on why women might be inclined to do such things to him. ""So what would you like? To win her back?"" <nl> He paused a moment, expression blank, then roared with laughter. ""Jesus, no, you idiot. I want to ruin her life."" <nl> I started. ""I'm sorry?"" <nl> ""She's insanely afraid of bugs. Like, crazy scared of them. I want to wish a swarm of locusts on her, some real biblical shit like that."" <nl> My jaw was slightly ajar. ""Don't you think you'd be better off using that wish for something else, something to improve your own life?"" <nl> He grimaced. ""Nah, I wanna fuck that slut over. I can get another one, eventually, anyway. My dad has a lot of sway in this department."" <nl> I shut my eyes a moment, then suddenly came alive. ""Well, allow me to help you-- Mr...?"" <nl> ""Jordan Henderson."" <nl> ""Mr. Henderson."" I pulled out a piece of parchment and a quill pen. ""Let's begin."" <nl> He frowned at my tools. ""What is this old-fashioned shit?"" <nl> ""I prefer to write my work, as a sort of personal touch."" <nl> ""Whatever. Do your thing. Make it last a while, by the way. Make her really suffer."" <nl> I bit my lip, thinking a moment, then scribbled a short passage onto the parchment. <nl> >I, Jordan Henderson, wish to have a plague of locusts, the insect, set upon my Katja in exactly 24 Earth hours from the time of placing this wish. It is to last 1,024 Earth hours and not affect any others nearby. <nl> He read it slowly, mouthing the words. ""Why does it say 'my Katja' and not just her name? She's not mine anymore."" <nl> ""Ah, well, genies are tricky. In Egoran, their language, a name is meaningless as multiple people can have the same name. They refer to people in their lives with a relational modifier for specificity. You don't know another Katja, do you?"" <nl> He shook his head. <nl> ""Excellent. This will work perfectly, then, with no confusion. We specified it must be the insect and must happen in exactly one day, along with a precise duration, which won't allow the genie any leeway."" <nl> ""Why's it so short?"" he asked, cocking his head at the paper. ""I thought these things were supposed to be super long."" <nl> ""Ah, well, normally they would be. However, your wish is very simple. Most other people need multiple stipulations, after toning down their wish to something feasible, but this is very straightforward. A good wish, Mr. Henderson, very clean."" <nl> He looked at the page and smiled. ""Perfect. How much do I owe you?"" <nl> I waved a hand. ""Free of charge for an important client with an important purpose. It didn't take long, anyway-- just recommend me to your friends."" <nl> ""Damn right, my man, good to run into someone that gets it. Good shit. See ya around."" <nl> Once the door shut behind him, I reclined in my chair and parted my lips into a wide smile, letting a little wisp of smoke trail out of my nose. I was concerned about who his father might be, but well, that was a problem for another day. Human men like him-- I've seen what they do to women they keep close by. And to call genies 'wishbitches'... <nl> But it's okay, because no woman would go near him for quite some time. That should help the world out, a little bit. <nl> Katja: slang for *kattjassen*. <nl> The Egoran word for 'penis'. <nl> ---- <nl> */r/resonatingfury* <eos>

Where they had once been a distant din, I could know hear the rhythmic chanting of their protest slogans. Prime Minister Basil had said that their protests were unfounded, but surely ignoring them wasn't working. Fires and looting followed in their wake, as it had for weeks. Surely there was *some* merit in their claims, if they were willing to go this far. <nl> I finger my prayer beads, watching as another building went up in flames. Another thing I'd always been told: our God would intervene. Our God would help.

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> Elena was a matryoshka painter.  At sunset, the woodworker Anatoly would knock on the apartment door with his wheelbarrow beside him.  Anatoly would give Elena all the plain figurines that he had carved that day, curving the balsam wood into the prospect of a head, shoulders and torso, then cutting the doll at her waist so that her legs would twist off, and hide her secrets.  Elena would pay Anatoly five hundred rubles for each full matryoshka and then she would go to her workshop (which was in fact only just the corner of her father's kitchen behind the stove) and she would paint the wood into beautiful women. <nl> Elena would paint the women with long eyelashes and blushing cheeks, and Elena would wonder what it would feel like to blush and flutter her own eyes, if ever a kind and handsome man were to pour vodka into a glass, and hand it to her, letting his fingertips pass over hers.  She would paint the women wearing elegant dresses adorned with tulips and roses, and Elena would imagine sewing an elegant silk dress to wear herself.  She would give the woman full-hearted smiles, and Elena would try to remember the last time she had smiled, apart from when she meant to attract the customers to her booth at the Udelnaya.  And then she would paint the next doll nested within, more intricately, but otherwise the same.  However, at their core, Elena's matryoshka contained a protest: open her dolls up to the final girl, the smallest and deepest girl of all, and you will find that she is not smiling or blushing, but instead has short eyelashes and a stern gaze. She wears only a plain grey dress.  For though Elena painted matryoshka, she had never known her own mother, and therefore knew that not all daughters will inherit. <nl> In the morning, Elena would pack her matryoshka in a box and take the bus to the Udelnaya, hoping to sell her work.  Most days, she would be lucky to sell two or three matryoshka.  But there was one day when she sold none at all, yet left the Udelnaya joyful. On that day, a certain tall man in a white dress shirt had come to the market.  There, he saw Elena at her booth with the shelves of matryoshka behind her, all red and green, gold and blue, and the man was enamored. <nl>The man gave Elena a piece of paper with directions to an elegant restaurant on the banks of the Moyka River. He gave her his credit card as well, and told her that were she to go buy a nice dress, that he would be honored to see her in it, and dine with her that evening. Elena was overjoyed, and as she stepped outside, she hailed a cab to take her to the boutique. <nl><nl> ""I have never seen a woman who I am more certain has a secret hiding inside her,"" the man said to Elena.  He was wearing a gold watch and many silver rings.  Elena told him that he could buy as many matryoshka as he wished, and discover everything within them.  But then the man said the woman he meant to describe was not any of the matryoshka, but Elena herself. <nl> The man gave Elena a piece of paper with directions to an elegant restaurant on the banks of the Moyka River. He he gave her his credit card as well.  He told Elena that were she to go buy a nice dress, that he would be honored to see her in it, and dine with her that evening.  Elena blushed, and then she smiled, even though she had not sold a matryoshka. <nl> That evening, instead of painting, Elena went to the best boutique in St Petersburg, and she bought a beautiful silk dress.  She then met the man at the appointed restaurant.  He spread caviar onto crackers for her, and poured her some vodka.  He asked her about her life, how many matryoshka she supposed she had painted, and if any were very special to her.  But, as the meal continued, Elena began to feel more and more confused and dizzy, until everything became terribly blurry.  When Elena awoke, she was no longer in the restaurant or in the small bed beside her father's.  She was standing upright, but frozen in pose, perched on a gold podium in a white expanse, more still and desolate than the Tauride Gardens after the first snowfall.  Elena was lined up neatly between a hundred other young women, all immobile as well. <nl> ""Where am I"" Elena asked, ""who are you all?"" <nl> ""That man who gave you a dress and dinner,"" the young woman beside her explained, ""was not in truth a man, but the wicked god of Motherless Girls.  He keeps us here as figurines, upon his shelf for all eternity.  He tells us that long ago, he once loved a goddess called Anna, who also had no mother, who was the First Woman, and that we remind him of her.  When Anna birthed their child, the girl was mortal.  So the god sought to kill the child as an abomination.  But Anna loved the baby, so she fled the heavens to the Barsky taiga.  The god chased her all through the trees, but Anna refused to return, and at last a bargain was struck: she would remain in the Barsky with her daughter, but thereafter Anna would become mortal as well.  But, if any of her descendants to ever live without a mother, the god would be entitled to reclaim those girls and bring them here, to remain forever in his collection."" <nl> Elena was crestfallen at the thought of never again seeing her father or St Petersburg, and of being frozen in place.  She screamed out to the god of Motherless Girls and demanded to be freed.  But the god just laughed, all throughout his menagerie. <nl> But then, after many days of considering her plight, Elena formed a plan.  ""Allow me to turn your collection into matryoshka!,"" she called out to the god, ""Let me separate each of these women into pieces, into clear layers, so that you might consider each part of her more easily, and find what it is in each of us that resembles your beloved Anna!"" <nl> Elena's proposal thrilled the god, for even after all his abductions, he was still no closer to grasping what it was that makes a motherless woman so special, so like the First Woman.  He released Elena's muscles and demanded that she go to work at once, separating and straining each of his women into a partwise matryoshka. <nl> From where the god watched, it appeared to him Elena was doing as she had promised.  But each time his back was turned, or when Elena carefully angled her subject and stood nose to nose, she would reach inside the girl, and she would pull forth her soul, which lives in her deepest layer.  Elena would hide the soul in her bosom until she could move on and quietly feed it to another girl, until every girl had taken in the soul of one of her fellow captives.  Finally, Elena pulled out her own soul and fed it to the woman whom she had been first placed beside.  At last, each captive woman had taken in the soul of another, thereby promising to care for it and nurture it.  Because of this, the women of the menagerie had all become mothers to each other, and were no longer in thrall to the selfish god. <nl> The god saw that Elena was no longer hard at work, so he returned to inspect her progress.  But as he entered the menagerie, all the captives suddenly broke from their poses.  All together, they hit and kicked the god, until he fled.  The menagerie with all its gold podiums vanished, and the girls fell through a void, until everything again became blurry. Elena awoke in her small bed in her father's apartment in St Petersburg. <nl> That night, Anatoly came at sunset with the blank wood for Elena.  For the first time, she did not paint the final doll with a stern face and grey dress.  For now, Elena knew that somewhere there was a woman who would always carry her soul, always nurture and protect it, and that this meant she would always have a mother to inherit from. <eos>

Story: <sos> Absentmindedly, Arlen turned the next page, ""Run"" was all that was written on that page too, though the page opposite it had ""Now"" sitting in the centre. ""Now"" was bolded. ""What a strange book"" Arlen thought ""probably postmodern"", which was odd given that the book was in an old leather binding and had fallen from the first editions shelf. <nl> It took a heartbeat for Arlen to notice that the room had gone dark, and that the after the chime of the door there had been no further noise in the shop, in fact all the noises had dimmed. She could no longer hear the traffic from outside and her own breath sounded muffled and distant. <nl> She looked up, the lights were still on but it was as if she were looking at them through a dark veil. Everything seemed heavy and sluggish. ""Sluggish"" Arlen said out loud and tasted how slowly and incoherently it came out of her mouth. She felt so strange, was she drunk? Had she been drugged? She struggled to think, to see, to breath, was it her or was it getting darker? <nl> A small part of Arlen's brain that was still functioning, frantically tried to get her attention ""Do something!"" it screamed ""this isn't normal"". Arlen tried to take a step towards the door and suddenly the room responded. The door seemed to throw itself backwards away from her, the walls flowing with it as if they had been made of tar. The floor started creeping up her legs and as Arlen looked down in horror at her feet, watching and feeling the heavy tiles of the shop shift up and attach themselves to her. As she looked down, she realised she still had the book open in her hand, only now the page didn't say ""Run"", it said ""Speak"" and on the opposite page ""the Truth"". <nl> Arlen said the first thing that came into her head, ""I don't know what is happening"". And as suddenly as it had happened the room flipped itself back into shape, the walls were normal walls, the floor was solid and familiar under her feet. <nl> The room was bright, the sound of buses and cars honking outside came flooding in and standing opposite Arlen was a young lady, dressed in a uniform, a benign expression on her face. When had she come in? Arlen wondered if she had hallucinated, if maybe the lady was there to help her. Then she realised, the lady was reaching out, for the book, and had stopped mid reach. <nl> ""I'm sorry"" the lady said sweetly ""I'm not sure I understand? I asked for the book and you agreed to sell it to me"". Still smiling she took the book, only Arlen did not let go. The lady stopped smiling, ""is there a problem?"" she said, and something about the way she said it made Arlen think of dark rooms and people sobbing behind locked doors. <nl> ""No. Yes. I'm sorry"" Arlen said, still finding it hard to speak, to think even. Why wouldn't the lady let go of the book? This wasn't normal, Arlen desperately wanted everything to go back to normal. ""Then give me the book"" the lady said out loud, no sign of kindness about her now at all. They stood there, both holding the book, and even though they did nothing else at all, Arlen started to feel bone tired, as if she were bleeding somewhere and her body was slowly shutting down and giving up on all its basic functions. <nl> Once more Arlen looked down at the book ""Run"", it said again ""Now"". <nl>It was strange, Arlen thought, that the lady had a tattoo of a book on her arm.""<nl><nl> This time Arlen paid attention, pulling the book out of the lady's hand she pivoted and ran through the back door into the store room and as she ran out, she heard the sound of laughter, both behind and in front of her. <nl> Edit: Part 2 in comment below <nl> Edit 2: I wasn't happy with the part 2 I wrote so I decided to try again - I've made a sub and will write off the cuff (what I did above - the bit I did below I overthought) so it will probably be very rough about the edges, but here goes... - sub and a new part 2 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBookOfConstraints/ <eos>

Statistically speaking I have helped save a lot of people. I deal with the stress and the pain and itching and I give people a new kidney or liver or whatever it is they need. Mine will grow back, and they get to live. <nl> The second thing you should know is that I remain connected to every organ I make.  Even after they leave my body, I can feel them. I can reach out to them, sense where they are, and even exert control. This is the really strange yet highly amusing part of my situation. <nl> They call me a hero, but they have no idea that I just made that lady smack her boyfriend across the face. <nl> She doesn't quite realize that she wasn't the one who wanted to do it. From my bench, across the clearing, I could see the confused look on her face, but she hasn't said she's sorry. His eyebrows narrowed in anger as he rubbed the pink spot in his cheek, and I could see that his lips clenching together. He wanted to tell her off if I had to guess, but he didn't want to make a scene. <nl> Those are the best ones to mess with if I am going to be honest. <nl> I guess you may need to know a third thing here... That guy is a total asshole. <nl> I don't like them. The people that treat other people like garbage, especially the ones that they are supposed to love. I don't like jerks, and whenever I can I like to help put them in their place. Being able to control the people who have my organs has really helped in this effort. <nl> The small man-child she calls her boyfriend stood up a  moment later. His fists are clenched, and he barely looks at her as she scoots herself off the bench behind them. I admit first to anyone who asks that the slap was satisfying, but it wasn't the end. <nl> Walking several feet behind them, I watch as her arms reach out and push him forward. It took a lot to stifle the laugh as he stumbled forward and fell on his knees. The guy has really had it coming for a while now, and watching his dignity slip away would bring anyone joy. <nl>When I reached out to it, I sensed the liver I had donated last week was not doing well. <nl><nl> That's all it took for him to lose his cool, and a fight broke out right there in the park. The scene he had tried not to cause and I knew at that moment that she was safe. Start a riot, and at the very least you earn the respect you deserve. <nl> I don't believe I'm a hero. The smirk that sat on my face didn't last very long after that, I knew that riots caused pain. I knew that she had just stood up for herself for the first time though, and that was something. <nl> So no, I'm no hero. But at least I try to use my abilities for good, and I will continue to do so until someone tries to stop me. <nl> As I left the park I felt a familiar flutter in my gut, pulling me down the street. I can always tell when an organ is nearby. <nl> /r/Beezus_Writes <eos>

I rise, dimly recognizing the sound of our own anthem. It is quite the entourage that comes to us. Their president, our greatest ally of twenty long years, heads the pack. I smile through the numbness. Malich is at my side, and I watch him do the same. I cannot help but wonder what is going through the mind of my friend. What will he think of me after this day? Would he stand there as he is, if he knew what I planned? He has always believed in me, in his emperor. I long for the days where I could too, when we were still the men we wanted to be instead of the ones we needed to be. <nl> When we took our first city, we were heralded as saviors. Liberators, they called us, in the wake of a now-forgotten tyrant. At the time I didn't blame them. The sight of our flags in those grimy streets, the glint off our uniforms in the sun... hell, you would've thought we were gods. <nl> But in time, they came to know. In time, as corpses piled and blood ran, we lost ourselves as saviors and embraced the role of rebels. The worst part was, they saw that as progression. More cities fell, more crowns passed hands, and somewhere along the line, rebels became conquerors. And when it was all finished, when the last foe lay vanquished, their conquerors became heroes. <nl> I am no hero. That much I always knew. My stomach twists as my counterpart approaches me, resplendent in white and gold, his grin as regal as his uniform. He looks about, relishing in the roar of the populace that surrounds us as he nears the foot of the stairs where I await him, and is then that I feel my conviction reinforced. I know what the world needs next. It needs peace. It needs balance. But as I watch this man before me, this man who so weaved a pattern of death across the land the very same as I did, I do not see peace. I only see more blood. More importantly, I see a people who crave it. I see a need for a new revolution that can only take place at the behest of any more violence. <nl> And I see that this revolution cannot happen with two conquerors at the helm. <nl> The president extends a hand to me. I take it in one of my own even as I clench the other beneath my coat. He turns to pose for the mob. Their cheers have never been louder. I bring out my other hand, and his face returns to mine just in time to see the gun at his forehead. And then it ends. With a single jerk of my finger, I end the reign of one conqueror and tarnish the legacy of another. There is blood in my vision again, real blood this time. Then screams. And then a rush. My weapon is out of my hand and I am knocked to the ground. I look up, and there, in the wake of my greatest crime, I feel neither shame nor regret. Instead I see Malich, alone, standing over me, and I feel overwhelming relief. <nl>And as the dust settles, I see the truth in Malich's eyes. He knows what he has done, what he has become. And in that moment, I can only pray that he finds the redemption that I could not. That he can carry on as the hero that I always wished to be.""<br><nl><nl> Because he knows what he must do. I gaze into his eyes even as I stare down the barrel of his revolver, and I know that he understands. I know that I, who only ever wanted to be a hero, must die a villain. I know that it can only be by his hand. But most of all I know that he, with all of the power and none of the notoriety, can bring for these people what I never could. And I know that he hates me for it. <nl> With a final flash of a muzzle, our war ends at long last. <eos>

Story: <sos> ""Kind of a lame addition to the Museum of the Millennium, eh, James?"" <nl> James shrugged, going back to mopping the floors. ""Yeah, guess so."" <nl> ""You didn't even look at it!"" <nl> ""Yeah, yeah, Aaron. Just give me a minute."" *Don't even know why they make me wipe these stupid floors. Cheapskates can't even afford some basic cleaning droids.* James lazily drug his mop across the shining marble floor, the harsh chemicals rendering any germs utterly obliterated, but leaving his work boots unscathed. *Long as I don't trip, there's nothing to be worried about. Why is Aaron so scared of this stuff?* <nl> James sighed as he leaned the mop against the wall, having finished the section he was working on. Course, he wasn't *done,* but that could wait for after Aaron was done with his bellyaching about whatever new artifact was added. <nl> ""Come on, man,"" James said as he walked over to the glass case where the artifact was held. ""New stuff gets donated all the time. Why you so interested in this?"" <nl> He glanced into the cage, raising an eyebrow. The artifact in question was...oddly shaped. Some kind of ring was in the center of it, with odd metallic objects dangling from the sides. They were all grooved, with some being larger than others, and though they bore the wear and tear of age, they still bore faded logos of companies long since- <nl> ""Should we touch it?"" <nl> ""What? No!"" James backed away slightly. ""I want to *keep* my job, man. Everyone knows you're not supposed to-"" <nl> ""-Not supposed to touch the artifacts, yadda yadda, I get it!"" <nl> *You most certainly don't care, do you?* <nl> ""All I'm saying is, this is the first on we don't recognize since that old...what was it? Threevee?"" <nl> ""Teevee, I think."" James sighs. Aaron would most certainly continue pestering him - since he was the head janitor, James had the only master key out of the night staff. <nl> ""Pleeeease?"" <nl> Most would consider Aaron's puppy-dog face adorable. <nl> James found it highly annoying. <nl> ""Fine. Just give me a minute."" James unlocked the case quickly, getting in between it and Aaron before the latter could grab it. If this was something dangerous, he didn't want it in that idiot's hands. <nl> As he unlocked it, a finger brushed against the metallic grooves, and James reeled back in shock. Hundreds of memories flew into him all at once, memories of a life long past - but one stood above the rest. <nl> *""Of course it would take 10,000 damn years to find my car keys.""* <nl>*James blinked, shaking his head to clear his thoughts. That memory couldn't possibly be real...could it?* <nl><nl> Edit: Didn't expect my story about losing car keys to earn me my first gold. Thank you so much! <eos>

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> The first thing to hit Cooper's senses when he first stepped into the top-floor office of Stellar Consulting was the smell of dirt. <nl> It seemed nobody had warned him about it during the interview with two of the firm's top partners, in a cafe down the office block two months ago. To be honest, it'd been so long ago that he couldn't even remember whether anyone had brought it up. <nl> Not a big deal, he thought. He'd get used to it. That was why he'd quit his job and spent a year traveling the world. Getting used to new things. Seeing new culture, and all that. Exposure. Employers loved hearing about that, and his interviewers had certainly perked up and excitedly jabbered about picking his brains on all the things he'd seen. <nl> But he couldn't help feeling a bit disturbed at the sight of his co-workers' desks as the HR lady showed him around the office. They were covered in ... soil. Freshly turned soil, it seemed, brown as coffee residue. And on each desk, creeper plants curled around jars of stationery and stacks of paper. <nl> Also, there were bean bags everywhere, in all colors. He had to climb over a small hill of them just to get through a corridor, though the HR lady did so with an unusual display of agility and poise. The meeting rooms were tastefully decorated--lots of steel and frosted glass--but almost every surface of the walls and glass were covered with Post-its. Some looked blank. <nl> Strange, but not the strangest he'd seen during his travels. <nl> ""You'll sit here,"" the nice HR lady said. They were all nice; every single one of the forty or so employees had seemingly permanent smiles etched on their faces. He tried smiling back to hide the slight dismay he felt upon seeing his earthy worktable. A fine, crusty layer covered his keyboard, and a curtain of leaves was hiding his monitor. <nl> ""Er, do you guys mind if I, uh, get rid of the plants?"" he said, gesturing at his computer. <nl> The HR lady--Kaarren, or so the badge clipped to her lapel claimed--smiled even wider. ""Of course!"" <nl> He nodded and eased himself into the chair, which was fortunately clean. The moment his butt hit the foam, the entire office erupted into applause, causing him to jump. Blushing furiously, he sank into his chair. <nl> A throat being cleared made him turn his head and regard the source. His neighbor was a bald, middle-aged man wearing a shirt so white it was almost blinding. He, Cooper noted, was most certainly not smiling. <nl> ""Welcome,"" the man said, sounding weary as he typed on his keyboard without looking at Cooper. That was when Cooper realized the man's desk was completely devoid of dirt. Not a single speck. <nl> ""My name is Cooper. Pleased to meet you,"" he said politely. <nl> The man grunted. ""Name's Michael. When you've got your coffee, I'm supposed to show you 'round some of our systems. Boot your computer and let's get ready to rumble."" <nl> Cooper nodded, admiring the fellow--he was the eye of normalcy in a hurricane of strangeness. Resolving to make this man his best friend, Cooper grabbed a mug from his desk and headed for the pantry. <nl>Oh, great Constellations,"" Arrnoldd muttered to himself. <nl><nl> *** <nl> About half an hour later, Cooper returned to his desk with a mug of boiling water. Despite his hopes, Michael noticed and snorted. <nl> ""Take it you didn't know how to use the mortar and pestle to grind the beans,"" he said. <nl> Cooper nodded. ""It's okay. I don't really like coffee, anyway. It's too acidic for me."" <nl> Michael shrugged. ""Whatever. You can ask Harreyy to help you out. He's that guy there--yeah, he's seen us staring, he's waving, oh how nice, wave back, that's right--okay, forget him, let's get started."" <nl> ""Have you been here ... long?"" Cooper said, a little timidly. <nl> ""Two years,"" Michael said. He grinned as he followed Cooper's gaze to his desk. ""Dumped the lot onto the floor on my first day. Ain't putting up with their shit."" <nl> ""They're ... weird,"" Cooper said. <nl> Michael stared at Cooper and stroked his chin. ""Hm ... could you be ... never mind. Yeah, but you'll get used to it. These folks don't mean any harm. They can be fun too, you know. Every Tuesday, the bosses order beer by the keg, and lots of calamari. Not sure why, but it's culture, they say. And on Fridays, they--well, you'll see."" He flashed Cooper a wicked grin. <nl> ""What?"" <nl> ""Guess you don't like surprises, huh. Let's just say we get rather entertaining dancers to liven things up."" Michael punched Cooper lightly on the arm, causing him to wince. <nl> Seemingly not noticing, Michael said, ""Alright, let's begin. Here, open up this program ..."" <nl> *** <nl> After his first toilet break, Cooper resolved to look for another one. This was a whole new level of weird--the toilet was simple a horizontal hole in the wall, waist-high. He simply couldn't hit the target and had to expand half a toilet roll to clean the mess up. <nl> He said nothing to Michael--if he wanted Michael to be his friend, he had to stop embarrassing himself in front of him. So he buried himself in his work, trying to ignore how his elbows kept sinking into the soil. <nl> The moment five o'clock arrived, every single employee in the place stood up and began packing their things away, seemingly in unison. Even Michael did it, though with slower and more wearisome motions. <nl> ""That's punctual,"" he said. <nl> Michael flashed him a grin. ""Hey, don't be the nail that sticks up, right? See you tomorrow."" <nl> Before long, the only person left was Cooper. He leaned back in his chair and rubbed his temples. God, what a day. The toilet was a nightmare--he'd have to find some way to hold it in. Feeling peckish, he headed to the pantry again. <nl> The cabinets held little else but coffee beans. The water cooler bubbled merrily in the corner as he searched under the sink. There were several packets of hot dog buns, with nothing in the way of fillings or condiments. Maybe those were for parties. He decided not to eat them. <nl> He was rifling through a fridge filled with what looked like jars of jelly when someone coughed behind him. He yelped and turned to find Arrnoldd, the managing director, watching him. <nl> ""Sir,"" he barked. <nl> Arrnoldd gave him a quizzical look. ""Still here, are you? Well, pack your things. I'm heading home. Everyone heads home at five, yes?"" <nl> ""Uh ... yes,"" Cooper said. The day's memories, from the bean bags to the toilet to the dirt-tables, came rushing to the forefront of Cooper's brain, and before he could stop himself, he said, ""Everything's so weird here."" <nl> Arrnoldd went almost completely still. Even the wispy hair on the top of his head seemed to have frozen solid. ""Weird ...?"" <nl> With a nervous laugh, Cooper rambled about the office and his co-workers. With every word, he thought the managing director was becoming more and more nervous. <nl> ""So, yeah. Just my feeling, but I like it here. Everyone's nice. Michael too. But he's ... different."" <nl> ""Yes,"" Arrnoldd said. <nl> ""It's almost like you're all aliens, and he's a human, but that can't be, right?"" Cooper chortled, mostly to himself. <nl> Almost imperceptibly, Arrnoldd's left eye twitched. If Cooper hadn't had to pay attention to the tics of various peoples worldwide, he wouldn't have noticed. ""Very strange,"" Arrnoldd agreed cautiously. <nl> ""Why, the dirt, and the toilet hole thing, almost makes me think you're Bxxghtli,"" Cooper said. <nl> Arrnoldd sputtered. ""What? How did you--oh, great Constellations."" <nl> Cooper clamped a hand over his forehead, horrified. ""So it's true? You're all aliens, and Michael's human?"" <nl> ""Who cares about that! You're an alien too! What are you doing here?"" <nl> Cooper shrugged. ""I come in peace. I just want a job. But I don't like the dirt."" <nl> ""We'll have it removed for you,"" Arrnoldd said. Green spots were beginning to appear on his skin--Cooper knew they signified relief. ""Jeez, and I was thinking we'd hired two humans."" <nl> Cooper frowned. ""Why?"" <nl> ""We thought we were studying humans in this office, but it turned out that we were studying aliens imitating humans. Imitating them pretty badly too, I have to say."" Arrnoldd looked wistfully at the human's desk. ""It's a pity, because we really like working with one another. And then we accidentally hired him. In case you haven't noticed, he's a bad fit. It's not good for our corporate image."" <nl> ""Shit,"" Cooper said. ""So fire him."" <nl> ""But that's the thing,"" Arrnoldd said sadly. ""We haven't learned how to deal with the fallout from terminating an employee."" <nl> *** <nl> *Thanks for reading!

They had yet to come across a mortal who had pledged themselves to all 16 of them. This wasn't just any mortal, either. This was possibly the most foolish of mortals, an amusing prize if ever there were any. He was quite powerful, to boot. Perhaps a bit too noisy, but well worth the soundproofing. <nl> ""Naturally, his soul belongs to me. Not only am I above you buzzing maggots, he pledged his soul to me twice. First when he took the mace, then again when he partook of the ancient blood.

The rot of Namira's breath silenced the Princes for a moment. Hircine, used to such smells, was the first to regain his composure. <nl> ""Besides, if that's enough to claim his soul, then I have as much claim to it as you! He pledged his soul to me when he partook of my ancient blood and claimed my artifact."" <nl> ""You think he is of your blood? This one is a dragon. The blood of dragons supersedes that of dogs and rapists alike, he is my kin and mine to claim."" <nl> Peryite's words went unheard or ignored. He was rather used to it. Malacath gave him a slap on the back, followed by some encouragement: <nl> ""Don't worry. You aren't a real dragon anyways, Pery!"" Booming laughter from the Prince of outcasts did little to improve his mood. <nl> Rising above the increasingly pitched argument came a flat, nasally voice: ""ENOUGH. His hand touched *my* beacon before any of-"" Before Meridia could finish with he indignation, Mephala capitalized upon her proficiency in assassination. Wordlessly, the Daedra nodded to eachother, agreeing that what just happened was for the best. Retaking the lead, Molag Bal marched forward and reached to seize the soul by force. His claws, however, were repelled. The dagger-like digits had never failed to anchor in something before. Not anything mortal, at least. The darkness of the forest in which the daedra had chosen to gather was split by blinding sunlight. Molag Bal broke out into a river of profanity. <nl> ""DAMNIT. DAMNIT. AKATOSH, DAMN YOU. YOU CAN FUCK RIGHT OFF AND..."" <nl> Ignoring the indignant daedroth, a sleepy-eyed dragon, pure gold in color, descended. After a long yawn, he began to mumble. <nl> ""Sorry I'm late, everybody,"" said the Aedric god of time, apparently unaware of the irony. ""I'm, uh... here to pick up my son?"" Taking a look at the soul, which was honestly closer to a swirling mass of powerful souls than any individual, he corrected himself. ""Oh, yeah. I guess I'm here to pick up several of them, in a way. Anywho, thanks for keeping an eye on him, guys."" Akatosh plucked the soul from the ground with a single claw and slowly retreated towards the midnight sun. ""See you guys at the next Convention! Or the last one. It's, uh, out of my realm of expertise. Anyways..."" The golden dragon was gone as abruptly as he had arrived, the night sky returning to its normal, starry self. The Princes looked at one another, and wordlessly retreated to their respective spheres of Oblivion. Meridia's aspect dissolved into light, and Molag Bal alone remained. With a furrowed brow, scowl, and limp tail, he pouted. ""Stupid divine."" <eos>

I stopped counting at a few days.They're getting very close to me, whoever they are. I can just *feel* the weight of the dirt lifting off the ceremonial prison coffin. It's an odd feeling, so much pressure after so many years, decades, centuries, millennia even. I can't even remember what I was buried for. <nl> OH GOD WHAT ARE THEY DOING- <nl> I slide in the coffin, hitting my head hard. They're taking me out? Oh I feel queasy. The motion, my head is spinning. I would puke if I'd eaten some time before I heard the scratching. The coffin jolts, the movement stops. I guess I was put down. <nl> More scratching, are they trying to open it? Oh please open the coffin, I don't want to be in here anymore- <nl> The lid opens, silencing my thoughts. I can feel the air rushing in, oh the cold, crisp air. I take a deep breath, my lungs filling with the intoxicating oxygen. <nl> MY EYES! IT BURNS! <nl> I hear screams erupting around me, I try to get up but my muscles seize, stumbling out of the coffin onto the grass I haven't felt in so long. I can't see anything, everything is too loud, I'm hurting all over. <nl> A whack across my head, I'm out like a sacrificed virgin. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> Oh god. My head hurts. I rub my head, somehow not confined. Where'd the coffin go- <nl> Oh riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight, right, I remember what happened. Wait- which means- <nl> I sit up, my back tenses. I'm free, from the coffin, those people, they saved me. I look around, my eyes strained by all the sudden light. I'm in a bed, in an odd white area. I've never seen any of these things before. Oh, there's even little suns in the ceiling. <nl> Someone enters the door through a movable hole in the wall. I can see they're startled to see me. They wear odd black clothing, sitting down next to the odd bed I'm on. <nl> ""Do you know your name?"" The person speaks, but, what are they saying?""Yfel tocnawan eow?"" I ask back, hoping for some kind of common language. But the person just stares at me, writing.""deos fricca eower? yfel macung heore?"" I press, hoping to get some clarification. I don't know who these people are, or where I am. <nl>Yes- ARGH this hurts lot.<nl><nl> ""I'm sorry, I cannot communicate with you."" They get up and leave again. <nl> I look around, seeing an opening in the wall, showing the outside. I get up, holding onto anything that will help, and walk over. I'm going to escape.I try climbing up, but there's some kind of invisible barrier. I knock on it, fully invisible. Maybe it can be broken-!The barrier shatters in little pieces of smaller, sharper barrier, all with a liquid-holding object. I make my escape, seeing the unfamiliar world around me. <nl> ""Yfel afierran!"" I shout, oh freedom feels great indeed. <nl> I get the hang of my physical self again, soon I'm running, and oh it feels GREAT! <nl> It feels great until I'm hit with a very large and fast object on black wheels. <nl> Oh this hurts, a lot. <nl> &#x200B; <nl> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ <nl> Please don't hate me for the translations, I got it off an Old English translating website so I have no clue if it's accurate.

Every decade or so, another snot-nosed brat would hammer at the gates, yammering something about destiny and how they had to right the ancient wrong or something like that. They generally were easy to kill, but this last one had blinded his favorite dragonling. Kiara was only 20 years old and not even able to breathe fire yet, and that lumbering oaf had blinded her! Enough was enough. <nl> Klaus gathered several of his dragonriders, and they flew towards the peak of Mount Vernon. As they neared the peak, strong winds began to pick up, trying to blow them off course. They landed and the dragons made their way up the mountain on foot, Klaus and his retinue huddled down in their saddles. <nl> A sphinx rose up in front of them. ""Only the pure of heart may approach-"" The rest of the sentence was lost as Klaus's mount, Kiara's mother, flamed it. They walked around the merrily burning pile of feathers and bone. <nl> They made it to the cave at the peak. ""Dinar, you come out here right this instant!"" Klaus roared. <nl>The dragons flew back to their lair, Kiara's siblings rejoicing at their successful mission. As they celebrated, Klaus couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. <nl><nl> The silence lasted for a few minutes. Finally, from deep inside the cave, a muffled voice replied, ""No."" <nl> Klaus glowered at the cave. ""I'm sick of you sending those naive idiots to bother me. Your sacrifice of these poor young fools must stop."" <nl> The voice replied, ""It's not my fault they're not strong enough to stop you."" <nl> Klaus drew his sword. ""Stop sending those children to do the dirty work for you. Come out and face me, man to man."" When no one appeared at the entrance, Klaus shrugged. ""Have it your way."" He directed his men to tear down the cave entrance. As the stones collapsed, he called out, ""No other mothers will lose their sons to your insanity. Stop bothering my people with your delusions. Father chose me to rule, and that's that."" As they flew away, Klaus shook his head. Hopefully this would stop Dinar's ambitions for a short time. <eos>

My uncle was dead on the floor, and he came. He pulled back his hood. I was terrified, but he had the face of an angel. His voice was calming and sweet. I vowed to see him again. There was the easy way, but it only guaranteed a brief visit with him. So, I plotted another way for us to date. <nl> As I grew, people around me had accidents. He would show up. We would talk though not for long. He told me to move on, but I never listened. I only wanted him. I wanted his icy hands all over my body. I was persistent. I kept after him. Though over time, his discontent with me grew. <nl> I could not stop. More died to feed my need for him. I wanted him in the deadliest of ways. On my 25th birthday, after my 33rd victim, he appeared. I threw myself on him, but he pushed me away. <nl> ""Abby, look, you're a cute girl, but I'm the Grim Reaper. I don't have genitals."" <nl> ""That's okay. We can make due."" <nl> ""Okay, fine, I was trying to be nice, but I'm going to come out and say it. I like men. Ted and me have a quite a life together."" <nl> ""Ted?"" I ask, tears welling in my eyes. <nl>Ted hugged him as soon as we arrived on the other side.<nl><nl> ""Bundy. Yeah, great guy. Don't feel bad. You're not the first to do this to win me over. I mean, Gacy, what a nightmare. Thought dressing up like a clown for me was sexy or something. And then there was Ed Gein. Sweet guy, but a little off. But, Ted has been a dream."" <nl> ""Aren't there other Reapers?"" I ask, ""Maybe you weren't the only one."" <nl> ""Nope, I'm it. Look, I have to go, but I'll see you in a few years."" <nl> ""A few years? Why?"" <nl> ""Oh, do you want me to spoil it?"" <nl> ""Yes,"" I demand, ""I need to know."" <nl> ""It's going to be a shocking conclusion to your life."" <nl> ""I get the chair?"" I ask. <nl> ""Yep, well, happy birthday!"" <nl> He kissed me on the forehead. I don't know if it was to add insult to injury or what, but, like that, he was gone. The police arrived soon thereafter. The trial and sentencing were quick. It took a few years, but I saw him again, hoping something had changed. But, Ted hugged him as soon as we arrived on the other side. Ted was a dream. That was much was true. <nl> *** <nl> If you enjoyed this, I also wrote a prompt about a serial killer ending up on a jury.

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> Something is wrong, or maybe it's right. Either way, the day is perfect, too perfect and vivid for any ordinary dream. The hill behind our house in the suburbs of LA when I was a kid, with the skyline and those lights just peaking out over the hills in the distance. The fading warmth and sunlight, just like all the nights I spent out there watching the sunset with only the company of a joint, wishing... <nl> ""Hi,"" she says, and her smile is perfect too. She sits on the tire swing, the dusty, barely hanging swing my father and I put there so many years ago. Or when was it, in this dream? <nl> ""Do I know you?"" I ask. <nl> ""Of course you do. Who am I?"" <nl> ""The girl of my dreams."" And she really is. Light freckles sprinkled like stardust, hair looking like it's on fire in the dying light. And the eyes, like staring into the greenest emerald you could ever see. Eyes I could stare into forever, and feel like I'd wasted no time at all. <nl> ""Why are you here?"" <nl> ""Why do you think?"" she asks. ""To fall in love with you."" <nl> ""And I'm supposed to fall in love with you?"" <nl> ""Of course,"" she says. <nl>Did you miss me?"" she asks, smiling broadly. ""How are you here?"" <nl> ""Come on,"" she says. ""I have someplace to show you. Although I think you've been there before...""<nl><nl> ""That doesn't really feel right to me. I have a girlfriend. We're getting pretty serious. And we work together too."" <nl> ""And that's enough? Deep down, you know. You two are only settling, because it's that time when people are supposed to settle down so all their friends and parents will stop annoying them. And eventually you'll start to hate each other, and hate yourselves for settling."" <nl> It's scary how right she is. I say nothing. <nl> ""I scare you, don't I? Because that's what you've always wanted the girl of your dreams to do. To tell you what you know, but don't want to admit..."" <nl> \- <nl> What was I supposed to do? When your dreams come knocking, you answer. <nl> I did get married to my girlfriend, out of some sense of obligation to someone. Maybe my parents. Maybe my sense of guilt for cheating on her in some way. <nl> But was it really cheating on her? In my dreams, everything I wanted came true. We fulfilled everything, from childhood dreams to explore Narnia to becoming a beloved writer to searching for the Infinity Stones in the galaxies with the Avengers. And we were together the whole time. <nl> My waking hours became sleep, merely a buffer to pass the time until I could return to my dreams. I lived lifetimes with her, new lifetimes every night, each starting and ending at the swing on the hill behind my house... <nl> \- <nl> ""How did you get here?"" I ask her, sitting on the swing, watching the sky fade like a dying phoenix. Our time together is winding down yet again, after a lifetime sailing the seas. <nl> ""What do you mean?"" she asks. <nl> ""I mean...where do you go when I wake up?"" <nl> ""I don't know,"" she says. ""I guess I go to sleep, too."" <nl> ""Can I ask you not to come anymore?"" <nl> She is silent, for a long time. There are moments like these, that suggest to me that maybe she has feelings too, that she isn't just some manifestation of my desires and lost hopes. <nl> ""Why?"" <nl> ""Because my girlfriend and I are thinking of having kids soon, and it wouldn't feel right..."" <nl> Surprisingly, she doesn't protest. <nl> ""Ok,"" she says, her voice choked up. ""If that's what you want."" <nl> ""I'll always love you,"" I say. <nl> ""Me too,"" she says. And as the sky fades, I close my eyes, and hold her tightly... <nl> \- <nl> I've lived a good life. Or at least, anyone else who looks at my life would say so. I worked diligently to provide for my family, and was faithful to my wife, and put in time with my kids. One of them even grew up to be a decently successful author himself, and that makes me almost as happy as if I had succeeded myself. <nl> But truth be told...I've always wondered. Did I make a mistake, letting her go like that? I guess maybe everyone in life has a choice like that at some point, duty or your dreams, and lots of people make the same choice as me. <nl> My family is here with me, at the end. I smile, and I am genuinely happy. It touches me to see all their tears, and feel their warm hugs. <nl> I close my eyes. <nl> When I open them, they are gone. And... <nl> ""Did you miss me?"" she asks, smiling broadly. <nl> ""How are you here?"" <nl> ""Come on,"" she says. ""I have someplace to show you.

I felt guilty for wanting to know, but I couldn't help it.  The number kinda surprised me, 12.  It was more than I expected, and I instantly had half a dozen more questions I wanted answers to. <nl> But I couldn't bring myself to dig any farther.  It already felt a little too intrusive.  It was then that I had another strange thought, what about the rest of my family?  The following morning, I decided to pry. <nl> ""Morning, mom.""  I said <nl> ""Morning sweetheart.""  My mother responded.  She was browsing Facebook on her iPad, as usual.  ""Have any plans today?"" <nl> ""Nah.  I was gonna go to the movies with Jeff, but he decided he just wanted to go with Jessica."" <nl> ""Well I'm sorry to hear that.  What movie were you going to see?  If it's not something scary we could go."" <nl> I giggled, ""It was actually something scary."" <nl> ""Well are there any other movies you wanted to see?  You know what, I'm gonna check and..."" <nl> I started the search before she could finish her sentence.  I was kinda nervous, what if... what if my mom had killed somebody?  I mean she was a nurse, would something like negligence count?  Zero.  Phew.  My mother is still a saint. <nl> ""Honey? Am I talking to a wall here?"" <nl> Oh shit I zoned out for too long. <nl> ""Sorry, what?"" <nl> ""I said have you seen this movie.""  She moved the iPad a little closer to my face. <nl> ""Oh, uh, yeah.  I saw it last weekend with a bunch of people from youth group."" <nl> She sighed, ""One of these days I'd like to go see a movie as a family."" <nl> We talked for a little longer before I wandered back to my room to play games with my friends online.  That evening, we decided to go out for dinner.  My younger sister Trisha brought her friend Rashida. <nl> We ate, the girls gossiped and looked at their phones the whole time, and then I remembered the question.  I looked across the table at my younger sister and decided to search.  I mean I'd already searched the rest of my family, it would be rude not to include her. <nl> Zero.  Obviously.  She's fifteen, she's weird but not that kind of weird.  Her and Rashida are certainly different, but they're just asocial types.  I took another sip of coke, and as I looked up again I nearly choked. <nl> ""Are you okay sweetie?""  My mom quickly responded. <nl> ""I'm fine."" I managed to cough out, my eyes watering, but still glued to the search bar over my sisters head.  That 1 wasn't there before.  My eyes scanned back and forth.  I wiped the tears away and quickly looked back up, still coughing. <nl> ""Can you cover your mouth when you cough?  F-F-S.""  Trisha said angrily. <nl> ""Sorry."" I said while still looking at the number above her head.  Ten.  *Ten*?!  Holy shit what the fuck.  I had to know more.  This had to be some kind of mistake.  Okay, what about number of people murdered.  Search.  Oh please, oh god no.  Still ten. <nl>My sister is a goddamn serial killer. Maybe she's killing bad people? Maybe it was all at once?<nl><nl> ""Hey mouth breather, can I help you with something?""  Trisha was scowling at me, Rashida too. <nl> ""Sorry I...""  I couldn't think of anything to say. <nl> ""Zoned out, even while you're about to choke to death.""  Trisha quipped.  Rashida smirked, blew air out of her nose, and rolled her eyes.  I didn't even have time to be mad.  My sister is a goddamn serial killer.  Maybe she's killing bad people?  Maybe it was all at once? <nl> Wait, did my parents know?  Or... what if she could search like I could?  Maybe she'd done what I'd only dreamed about doing.  Finding evil people, and murdering them. <nl> Can my sister search like me.  Search. <eos>

Story: <sos> ""I won't try to stop you taking whatever you want, but just so you know... everything always makes its way back soon enough,"" The shop owner said. A look of pity on her face. <nl> Darren raised an eyebrow, but kept the pistol aimed at her. He could hear the first wail of a siren in the distance. Was it for him? The woman hadn't moved since he'd drawn his weapon. <nl> ""You might want to hurry,"" she said. <nl> The sirens grew louder as his grip on the pistol grew sweatier. His fingers felt hot against the metal as if he'd already fired it. His eyes darted around the store and then at the counter in front of him. <nl> He pointed down at the glass. ""How much is that worth?"" <nl> ""It sells for fifty thousand, but to you it might as well be worthless."" The woman slid open a compartment, taking her time. Her fingers found the diamond locket and pulled it from the felt display. <nl> Darren snatched it the moment it was above the counter. He let it dangle in front of him. The silver chain seemed to shine just as bright as the lights trapped inside the giant diamond. <nl> ""Take it."" she gestured to the door. ""I won't stop you."" <nl> The sirens were so loud. It sounded as if there were a squadron of police cruisers right behind him. He shoved the necklace into his pocket, a bit of chain stuck out, and then ran through the front door. On his way out he tucked the pistol in the back of his jeans. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ** *** ** <nl> Mariah watched the people pass over her turf. She held her cup out and rattled the coins inside. A few passersby shot her dirty looks, but most  of them ignored her. She preferred anger or disgust to apathy. At least they acknowledged her existence. <nl> ""Change,"" she called out and shook her paper cup again. She'd gotten it last week when someone had tossed his half-finished drink on her. Though it had brought her close to tears, it also had the effect of making those on the street who'd witnessed it more generous. <nl> *I should see if I could get someone to pour their drinks on me more often*, Mariah thought. <nl> Today's haul so far was three quarters, ten dimes, two nickels, and a bunch of pennies she didn't want to bother counting. There was also the wad of gum that had been dropped by a snickering teen. Mariah had been pleasantly surprised to find that it had still contained a decent amount of its mint flavor as she'd popped it into her mouth. <nl> Her eyes caught a man shuffling down the street. He kept casting nervous glances over his shoulder. As there was nothing to be gained from a man so disturbed, Mariah began to look elsewhere. <nl> Something flashy caught her eye. <nl>His hands searched over her.<nl><nl> Sticking out of the man's pocket was a line of silver. It seemed to call out to her. She was no pickpocket--only ever tried it that one time. The idea of a repeat of her first attempt made her throat tighten up. <nl> She couldn't look away. Her tongue found its way to her lips as she slid it back and forth. <nl> When the man was close enough, she sprung forward. <nl> ""Excuse me, sir."" Mariah reached outwards, placing her hands on his chest. His eyes looked her up and down with an exaggerated grimace as if a rat had just jumped out of a dumpster and onto his leg. <nl> The man swung his arm into her shoulder and shoved her aside. Before she tumbled down, her hand found the length of chain. She tightened her dirty hand into a fist and pulled. <nl> She got it! <nl> Mariah hesitated for a moment as the diamond sparkled in front of her, dangling from her sticky fingers. She quickly stuffed it into her shirt. <nl> ""You little..."" the man's words turned guttural as he lifted her up off the sidewalk and threw her up against a storefront. ""Where'd you put it?"" <nl> His hands searched over her. <nl> ""Help!"" She shouted. ""Someone please help me."" Mariah tried to squirm out of his grasp as a hand traveled up her chest. <nl> The left side of her face exploded with pain. She hadn't even seen his fist coming. She was barely aware of the ground rising up as she fell. Somewhere nearby a woman was shouting, ""Someone stop him! He's beating her!"" <nl> Feet stomped and scratched the concrete around her. When Mariah looked up she saw the a crowd of men pushing her attacker back. The man's hands were still reaching for her. His eyes wild and bulding. Her cheek felt wet and warm. <nl> Mariah sat up and felt along her face. Her fingers came back bloody. She thought of the necklace and the world snapped back into focus with startling clarity. She still had it. She could feel the cold metal against her skin. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ---- <nl> Seymor waited in the alley. This was not his home, but he could count on the occasional meal here. Sometimes the woman spared a scrap for him. More often than not all she had was a scratch behind the ear and some kind words. It was more than he was used to. <nl> His paws padded against the shadowed concrete as he relieved himself against a dumpster. The smells that wafted from it and containers like this drove him mad with desire. <nl> A noise brought his attention away from the delicious aromas of the trash. <nl> The nice woman stumbled into the view between the two buildings at the edge of the alley. She didn't even see him as he waggled his tail and spun around a few times as she usually liked. No, her attention was on something else. Something shiny. <nl> She plopped herself down on her old mattress and stared at her hands. No, she stared at the shiny thing in her hands. As was he. <nl> ""How much are you worth?"" She asked. <nl> Seymor raised his ears. He was pretty sure people usually talked to each other, not things. He edged closer to the nice woman. His body tensed as he felt the need for caution. <nl> ""Sorry, boy. No food today,"" she said without looking at him. Her voice sounded rough, almost angry. <nl> If he understood anything beyond the word 'food', it wouldn't have mattered. Seeing the shiny thing up close made his mouth water and tail shake more than the scents from the dumpster. <nl> ""Why're you looking at me like that?"" The woman asked. ""Go on. Get!"" <nl> She swatted at him, but he leapt back just in time. Seymor moved closer. When she swatted again, he took his chance. He ducked under her arm and closed his jaws around the shiny and darted away. The taste of metal and sweat filled his mouth. He had the shiny toy! <nl> He felt her fingers grasping, digging into his fur. Years on the streets, only bathing when there was a heavy downpour, his hair was greasy and hard to grab hold of. Seymor slipped right out. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ---- <nl> Prey. Far above the city's rooftops, she searched for prey. The wind blew through her feathers as she glided, her wings outstretched, hugging the air. <nl> The people sometimes dropped food, but nothing was as good a juicy mouse or... <nl> A sparkle on the ground caught her eye. She saw it bounce up and down as it was carried down a lonesome road. She swooped down for a closer look. <nl> Her shadow fell over the dogs back. She'd caught a closer glimpse of the dangling necklace. Oh how it sparkled. How it shone! Thoughts of prey turned to how she might decorate her nest. Though she'd built it years ago, she always had kept an eye out for things that caught the light. <nl> The dog looked up as she passed a second time. It growled, baring its cruel teeth up at her. She rose to the sky. The cool air up this high filled her lungs and made her feel invincible. The only though in her mind: shiny. <nl> This last dive was almost vertical. Her body whistled through the air. At the last second, the dog reared up on his hind legs and clawed at her. He made the mistake of snapping his jaws, trying to catch her neck. <nl> Through the dog's spittle and ruffle of feathers from his swinging paws, she managed to close her beak over the chain. The shiny. <nl> The dog raged below as she tore back to the sky with thoughts of where in her nest she'd place it. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ---- <nl> Samantha stepped outside and gazed into a near empty parking lot. Her store in this strip mall wasn't the last to close, but business usually tapered off quickly after seven. <nl> She heard the high pitched squeals and excited squawks from up high. <nl> *So soon?* She smiled. <nl> Back inside the store, Samantha moved behind the counter and pulled out a cardboard box. From it she snatched a roll of aluminum foil and tore off a small square. As she made her way back out the store, she crinkled it up into a small ball. <nl> Behind her building she climbed the ladder to the roof. From here she could see the setting sun in the west. Just enough light left in the day for one last transaction. <nl> The hawk watched her approach. It moved a wing to cover the diamond necklace it had started to embed in the fibers of its nest. <nl> ""Mindy,"" Samantha said as she waggled the balled up aluminum foil. ""Thank you for finding my necklace."" <nl> The bird flapped its wings and screamed something only its kind understood. It moved its body over its treasure, guarding it. <nl> ""Mindy."" Her voice grew stern. She pulled out a flashlight and tossed the aluminum ball across the roof. Samantha watched as the hawk eyed the shiny metal foil skip across. <nl> When the light from the flashlight danced along the dozens of edges and creases of the foil, the hawk began to lurch out of its nest. <nl> ""That's right, Mindy."" Samantha inched over to the nest. ""It's all yours. More shiny for your nest."" <nl> Keeping her light on the foil, Samantha yanked the necklace out of the nest and back away. The bird would forget once it was out of sight and her new shiny was in her nest. She always did. <nl> Samantha walked back into her store and replaced the necklace. She breathed a sigh of relief and left her shop. <nl> Shiny things were the easiest to get back. Samantha was still waiting for the antique lamp to find its way back to her. As she started her car, she wondered where it was at this moment. What pair of hands had it passed over to today? It didn't matter. <nl> ""Everything always makes its way back soon enough..."" She smiled as she gave one last look at the shop and then drove off. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ---- <nl> /r/StevenLee <eos>

Story: <sos> I always regretted the name. <nl>They said they would write it up as accidental, but we knew it for what it was. I was old enough to understand. It was like that until mom got sick.""<nl><nl> I loved the rock, just hated the name. If you're going to be given a lifelong companion at the age of ten, I feel like you should be extended a do\-over on the name front at some point. But it is what it is. <nl> Rocky. Rocky the Rock Pet. <nl> Receiving your rock pet is a big deal. Granted, it doesn't take much to qualify as a big deal when you're ten, but I still remember the handoff with some affection. It was the day of my birthday and mom took me in the car downtown. Every town that had more than a few buildings had a certified Rock Handler. <nl> Our Rock Handler was Franklin, the nice man who tended the corner store. He had a rock that was just for me. It came in a little box with a bow on it. The tag read: ""To: James Williams, From: US Department of Rocks."" I remember carefully untying the ribbon and removing the top of the box. The rock was wrapped in some tissue paper and there was a paper with a bunch of instructions on it. <nl> ""What are you gonna name it Jimmy?"" Franklin asked. <nl> ""Rocky,"" I replied, staring into the box in wonder. <nl> ""You know how special Rocky is, right?"" <nl> ""Yes Mr. Donnelly, I know. He is going to be my friend and we're going to grow up together."" <nl> ""That's right. You take extra care with it, ok? You only get one because there is only one in the whole wide world for you."" <nl> I nodded, and spoke into the box, my voice a whisper, ""Don't worry Rocky. I'll aways protect you."" <nl> My mom smiled at Franklin and then knelt down beside me. ""I think Rocky is a great name. I still have Princess and she is one of my very best friends."" She patted her pocket. ""It will be exciting to see what both of you turn out to be."" <nl> Once we were back in the house, I pulled Rocky out of the packaging and looked at him for the first time. He felt very heavy in my hand. He was white with little swirls of grey and shaped a bit like a brick. I memorized every little detail, knowing that he would change over time. I wondered what he would become. <nl> It was the happiest day of my life. <nl> Maybe its sad that receiving a rock meant so much to me, but I didn't have a lot to begin with. We weren't rich. Mom worked at the grocery as a checker and dad worked on the line at the manufacturing plant. We didn't go on trips, or out to eat, or any of the things people always seemed to be doing on the TV. There wasn't money for that. It was ok, food was on the table and I had two parents that loved me. <nl> I spent a lot of time alone. Dad worked the night shift and mom was working doubles a lot. But I had a pet rock. Every day I would sit with Rocky and tell him about the things happening in my life. Every night before bed, after mom gave me my kiss, I'd give Rocky an inspection to see if he had changed. <nl> He never did. <nl> My life changed though. A few years later the plant shut down. Dad said he didn't know how to do anything else but work the line, so he didn't do anything else. He was very angry. He drank. A lot. He wasn't nice when he drank. It just seemed to make him more angry. Sometimes that anger would be directed at me, but mostly he went after mom. <nl> I knew something was wrong, but it I didn't know how to fix it. Dad was broken. His rock was broken too. I saw it on the ground of the basement one day. It was black and split in two. He didn't know how to put himself back together. I think he wanted to, but maybe it just got harder every day and he lost the way back. <nl> I held mom a lot when she cried. I didn't cry. Not in front of her. <nl> I waited until it was quiet in the house and then I would crawl into the bed and would cry with Rocky in my hand. Every night I would look at him, hoping that he would change. That he would let me know that I was growing and becoming something different. That the future might be different than the present. <nl> But he was still the same. <nl> My life changed more. Got worse. There were fights now. Physical ones. Mom wasn't very big or strong so she lost a lot of the time. Sometimes I would try to push dad away. His eyes were wild, like an animal. He couldn't control himself any more. When he was sober, I could see the regret, but he couldn't figure out how to say sorry. To make it better. <nl> Mom said she should leave him, but she couldn't. She said she had made vows and that they meant something. I didn't understand why those words she said all of those years ago were more important to her than herself. But I was still young. So I was there to put her back together when he broke her apart. <nl> And then one day he was gone. <nl> He walked down to the basement and he never came back up. The police came by and made a report. They said it was alcohol poisoning. That he had drank enough to kill three men. They said they would write it up as accidental, but we knew it for what it was. I was old enough to understand. <nl> For all of the pain he had caused, mom still loved him. She wasn't the same after that. She smiled less. Her days were simply a routine that she followed to get to the next day. Men would float into her life and float back out without making an impression. Sometimes, she would tell me she blamed herself. That he killed himself to spare us. <nl> I don't know what I think about that. All I can think of when I think of dad was that black rock split into two on the basement floor. <nl> Rocky was still the same though. Not a swirl had changed. <nl> It was like that until mom got sick. Cancer. Maybe it was all of the cigarettes. I don't really know. She was so ill. She had nothing left to fight it off with. Life had hollowed her into a shell and cancer crumpled that shell.  She faded away.  She had given everything to me and I couldn't do anything to help her. Just sit beside her on the bed as she decayed. <nl> One night, as we sat quietly in the hospital, I pulled out Rocky. He looked just the same. As he always did.  I broke down into tears. <nl> ""What's wrong honey?"" Mom whispered, her voice thin and reedy. <nl> ""He still looks exactly the same. Just like a rock."" <nl> Mom smiled and patted me on the hand. ""That makes sense Jimmy."" <nl> ""Why?"" <nl> ""Because you were always my rock."" <nl> And then she was gone. <nl> r/PerilousPlatypus <eos>

"There is one major continuity error, a lapse in the self-consistency of the narrative, in the story provided. Count the number of '<nl>' in the story that occurs before the continuity error. Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> Some people chase after money. Others chase after love. Still others chase after books, movies, hell, even writing. I couldn't even imagine: just sitting in front of your computer coming up with stories. Why do that when you could go out and make your own? <nl> But all of them, yes even the writers, are looking for one thing: that elusive Rush. The feeling you get once a blue moon that makes you think, ""yeah, this is what I live for."" The pounding heart, the excitement, the adrenaline, the *life.* Some people get it when getting that paycheck others get it by driving at 300 miles per hour or jumping off a plane. <nl> I got the Rush by watching the light fade out of someone's eyes. <nl> I looked in the mirror again. Red lipstick but not too red. I was playing Mary Sue - inexperienced, but eager. I wore a dark blue dress that fell down to my ankles with but an open back. Little eyeliner to accent my eyes, and my dark hair was pulled into a simple ponytail. The perfect Mary Sue. <nl>After taking another swig of the poisoned beer, I discreetly slipped the antidote into my own drink when he wasn't looking.<nl><nl> I blew a kiss to the mirror and went to see my date. <nl> *** <nl> He was ten minutes late. <nl> He looked like his profile picture at least. Tall, he was around my height, tan skin and curly blond hair. He wore a button down shirt with rolled up sleeves and black pants. Time to play my part. <nl> Though I wanted to throttle him for being late I got up in a calculated movement, expertly knocking my chair back, like I was some flustered idiot, and stumbled. <nl> He was at my side immediately, helping me regain my balance. I fluttered my eyes at him. ""Oh, I-I'm sorry, I'm always just so clumsy."" I used an old theater trick to make the blood rush to my cheeks, making him think I was blushing. <nl> ""Oh, um, it's fine. In fact, I should be the one apologizing for being late,"" he said, looking like a kid who'd gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar. <nl> I laughed at the expression. Wow, that was actually kind of cute. <nl> ""So, um, should we sit?"" <nl> *** <nl> He told me jokes and stories. I just blushed at first, giving him slight smiles, but then as I sipped at the wine, I let myself open up, laugh a little more, casually brush my fingers against his. This one was devious. I could see the glint in his eyes now that wasn't there when he'd help me from my stumble. The innocent face was a disguise. A damn good one at that, if it had fooled me, though only for a few minutes. <nl> But I wasn't me, I was Mary Sue. So, I drank more wine and laughed harder at his jokes. I guess I'd take him back to my kill house - his type would say yes, I was sure. <nl> I could probably overpower him, but he was well built and must have at least 50 pounds on me, Didn't hurt to be sure though I supposed. So when the food arrived, I made a show of digging in my purse for my phone. I opened a case inside my purse and carefully picked up a single grain of the poison and crushed it between two of my fingers. <nl> I flashed him an embarrassed smile and squeezed his fingers - getting the colorless poison on them. We were having wings, so no silverware involved - he'd ingest the poison. It wouldn't kill him immediately, but it would begin working through his system, making him weak, easier to overpower. <nl> Another job well done. He opened both of our bottles of beer with his key chain bottle opener and we clinked our glasses. I took a swig of the drink. He put his drink down and bit into one of his wings. <nl> Both of us froze. <nl> That *bastard.* It was subtle, but it was there. Gloriella. It didn't really have a taste, but I could feel the powder warm on my tongue as I drank the beer. He was here to kill *me.* It wouldn't kill me immediately, I had a couple of hours to safely to take the antidote. He had frozen too, a bit comically, with his teeth half biting into the wing. He recognized the poison. <nl> I began to laugh. <nl> He shook his head and showed me his teeth; a predator's smile. I matched his with one of my own and undid my hair, letting it fan across my back while he unbuttoned the top button of his shirt. Seemingly small gestures to any onlooker, but to professional killers it was like taking off a costume. Mary Sue was gone with her silly laughing and perpetual blush. <nl> He had changed too. Gone was the good boy look, and the more sinister side I'd seen a shadow of dominated him now. He leaned back in his chair, wearing an expression of supreme confidence. <nl> ""Poison on the fingers eh?"" he said with a sardonic smile, not even bothering to keep his voice low. No one would hear us over the din of conversations all around us. <nl> I shrugged one shoulder in a casual gesture. ""Less cliche than poisoning a girl's drink at least."" <nl> He rolled his eyes. ""Oh please, the classics are classics for a reason. If it works, it works."" <nl> ""Well,"" I said after taking another swig of the *poisoned* beer. ""It didn't."" <nl> He blinked a few times at me drinking again, then a slow smile spread across his lips. A game. He dropped the wing entirely and very purposefully sucked the tips of his fingers clean, making sure to get all the poison I'd gotten on them. <nl> ""You missed a spot,"" I said, and offered him my hand. <nl> ""My, my, aren't we forward,"" he said, putting his hand on his chest in mock shock. But he then took my hand is other one and kissed my fingers. <nl> I raised my own beer in salute and drank the rest of it in one gulp. <nl> *** <nl> We were outside now, and he walked me to my car like a real gentleman. I had no idea where this was going really, but I was ready. I had a knife strapped to my thigh and a gun in my purse. I wasn't an idiot but...I wanted to see where this was going. <nl> We got to my car and I turned to him. Only part of his face was illuminated by the neon lights of the restaurant sign, but I could see one half of his lips curve up in that trademark smile of his. <nl> He leaned forward and, after a moment, so did I. <nl> Our lips touched. <nl> We stood there, not kissing, but touching lips, exchanging the poison residue both of us had on our lips. It was stupid, borderline suicidal, but hell if it wasn't fun. He pulled back a shade before I did. <nl> My heart was beating wildly, threatening to jump out of my chest, and my cheeks were actually flushed. This was it, the Rush. And no one had died, or at least, not yet. <nl> ""So...will I see you again?"" he asked. <nl> I grinned. <nl> *** <nl> (minor edits) <nl> If you enjoyed this, you'll like a story I wrote for literally this exact prompt like half a year ago. Though I warn you it goes a little bit....differently.

Story: <sos> They came for him at dawn, screaming across the dusty plain, throwing up a choking cloud in their wake which turned the sun red. He knew this was an entirely dramatic decision, since she'd set up camp sometime the afternoon before. Within sight of the city's towers. <nl> The gates and walls of Newhaven were more than strong enough to keep them out, but that wasn't what he wanted. His men had their orders, all civilians had been evacuated to the bunkers. They were ready. He was ready for his audience. <nl>I'm not waiting until then! You're a monster!"" <nl> She loosed the arrow - the look on her face suggested she hadn't meant to do it, or maybe that she was surprised she had dared too. The arrow flew surprisingly true (she must have been practicing) and lodged in his vest. He took half a step back, bumping into the desk, and let out an irritated grunt. Before he could do anything else there was a deafening report, followed by a heavy thud. <nl> He looked down at his crumpled daughter, horrified. Then she rolled over, pressed a hand to the exit wound just above her hip (which was, thankfully, oozing rather than gushing) and began to weep hysterically. <nl> ""Daddy! He shot me, you let him shoot me!"" <nl><nl> They burst through the gate, apparently not even registering how easy it all was. Either they were too used to attacking the smaller settlements and steads around Newhaven, or this was their first raid. Either way, it was going to be their last. It wasn't every day the bandits actually presented themselves to you, after all. <nl> She took an astonishly long time to reach him, though he deliberately stayed in his office. She must have stopped for a rousing speech or two along the way. He stood wearily as she burst through the door, bow at the ready, dark hair flying dramatically. Only her closest lieutenants were with her, each similarly armed with longbows, crossbows and swords. <nl> ""Hello, *father*!"" She spat, tossing her head. <nl> ""Jane."" He said, sighing inwardly. ""Glad you're home safe."" <nl> ""I've returned!"" She said, in what she obviously believed was a fierce, rabble-rousing voice. In reality, she just sounded like a sixteen-year-old girl having a temper tantrum. <nl> ""I see that."" <nl> ""I've returned,"" she repeated, her eyes flashing, ""to free the people from the yoke of their cruel tyrant! I've returned, Father, so that we can rebuild society as something good for all, so that my child will never know a world of oppression, indecency, and indignity!"" <nl> At that she threw a look at Jaime, Tom Brandon's eldest boy, who was stood right behind her. It was obviously meant to be a meaningful glance, or maybe a longing one. Instead they both just looked a bit constipated. The pause gave him a chance to process what she'd said, however. He slapped a hand over his face, groaning. <nl> ""Fuck's sake, Janey, you're pregnant too?"" <nl> ""This isn't about who I choose to love!"" She cried dramatically, her face turning red as a bead of sweat began to trickle from her hairline. ""This is about..."" <nl> ""It's about me grounding you,"" he said sharply, dropping his hand. He gestured, and his men came forward, rifles at the ready. Jane's followers looked uncertain now. ""It's about you thinking we love Hannah more. What this is about, Jane, is a child having a tantrum and running off to join some bandits with her friends. That's what this is about."" <nl> ""I didn't join the bandits!"" She yelled. That attempt at a revolutionary tone had vanished now. She stamped her foot. ""They're temporary *allies*. I'll reward them when I take over, so..."" <nl> ""They came with you because they thought they'd get to pillage the city while you were up here."" He said, deliberately staying calm. ""Don't worry, I'll deal with them. Kids, you hand your weapons over to my men now. Your parents have been worried sick about you all."" <nl> The other kids, staring down the barrels of actual guns with the crackle of gunfire outside, handed over their gear willingly. One, a girl who couldn't have been older than twelve, started to cry. Jane stamped her foot again and shrieked wordlessly. <nl> ""You always have to ruin *everything*!"" She screamed, ""I'm going to take over the city and free everyone from slavery, and *you can't stop me*!"" <nl> ""Jane, no one here's a slave. This is the only truly safe place for half a continent. People are happy to be here. You've been out there now, you've see. That, haven't you? Anyway, you'll get your chance to lead when I retire..."" <nl> ""I'm not waiting until then!

Blue smoke still rose in curly tendrils, proof that he had spellwoven correctly. <nl> ""Er, yes, the spell was performed quite impressively,"" said Winston, whose vocabulary was very notable given that he had only been given to variations of ""woof"", ""bark"", ""whine"" and ""growl"" before today. <nl> ""So it's not the spell, and it's not the circle,"" said Bob, as he got on his knees to inspect his preparations again. ""And I'm not mad, though of course if I really was I wouldn't know it. But let's assume my mind is still my own. That leaves only a number of possibilities."" <nl> Winston sat on his rump, then started scratching at his ears with his hind paws. He waited patiently, though truth be told, it was not like he had anywhere to go, not until Bob released him. <nl> Bob snapped his fingers, and fine filaments of power flowed into the circle, throwing up a cascade of sparks. ""As long as the circle holds, I can compel you to speak the truth,"" said Bob. ""So answer me this - are you the very same pet that has been by my side for the last 3 years?"" <nl> ""You don't need to compel me,"" said Winston. ""I'm just happy to finally be able to speak. You have no idea how difficult it was to communicate without words."" <nl> ""Well, are you?"" pressed Bob. ""Are you the same dog?"" <nl> ""Yes, I am."" <nl> ""Second question then"" said Bob. ""Are you also really the most powerful demon there is in the underworld?"" <nl> Though he tried to keep his expression neutral, Winston's energetic tail wagging gave away the fact that he was positively brimming with pride. ""Well, that's not what I would say of myself,"" said Winston, ""but I know that there are many humans who call me that, you know? The other demons will never admit it, but it's been some time since any of them have challenged my turf."" <nl> ""Really?"" asked Winston. ""You're Nazcara, also known as the Quencher of Flames, the Worldender, the Final Horseman? The demon which single-handedly stopped the High Priest Malison from conquering the entire world in the 12th century? The immortal foe which the greatest bloodknight in human history, St Lueda, couldn't quell in the 17th century? The cursed beast which halted the campaign of Emperor Xu Lei in the 19th century?"" <nl> ""That's me,"" said Winston. <nl> ""A golden retriever did all that?"" asked Bob, throwing up his hands in the air. <nl> Winston shrugged, or at least gave the best impression of one which a dog could muster. His tail started wagging again. ""This form suits me well,"" he said. ""Some of the other demons prefer other sorts of eldritch horrors, but this... this works just fine."" <nl> ""How much power do you actually have?"" asked Bob. ""Because I'm sensing a whole lot of nothing coming from that circle. I'm not sure you have more than two fireballs in you, even. Is there more? Are there hidden reserves of magic in you, ready to be unleashed?"" <nl> Winston's tail flagged for a moment. ""No, not really,"" he said. ""What you see is what you get. Hey, as I said, I never claimed to be the strongest or anything. It was your spell that had its own interpretation of what the most dangerous demon would be."" <nl> Bob held on to the tether connecting him to the portal, then he stumbled back, and plopped himself onto the nearby chair. ""But... this is all wrong,"" he said, more for his own sake than for Winston's. ""I put the last of what I had into that spell. The last of my fortunes, my bloodsacrifices... that spell was all I had left. And I find that it's you? Why were you already with me all along? It doesn't make sense..."" <nl> Out of habit, Winston moved to comfort his master, but his snout bounced off the edge of his prison. ""What were you looking for when you summoned me?"" he asked. <nl> Bob thought for a while, then said, ""Power, of course. Power."" <nl> ""Don't you already have that?"" <nl> ""I do,"" said Bob. ""But something's... gone awry. I'm still strong, stronger than most of my peers. But I've hit a wall, hit the limits of what I can do. Every time I take another step forwards, I find myself merely... content to be where I am. I wanted to harness your powers, reignite the hunger within, claim what is rightfully mine."" <nl> ""But why do you want to do that?"" asked Winston. <nl> Bob laughed, then suddenly hit the tabletop with such force that the half-consumed candles on the stand fell off. ""I'm asking the questions here! Who sent you! How did you find me! What have you been doing by my side these 3 years?"" <nl> Winston cocked his head to the side as he tried to recall the information he needed. ""A coalition summoned me,"" he answered. ""A group which formed against you, comprised of your enemies. They pulled me out from the underworld 3 years ago, then deposited me at your doorstep, giving me little time to finalize my form."" <nl> ""Why, why would they do that?"" asked Bob. <nl> ""Why, to stop you, of course,"" said Winston. ""To ensure you never fulfilled your destiny of taking over the world."" <nl> The answer had barely left Winston's snout when the realization hit Bob like a gale-force tornado. The moment of clarity was so strong, so thoroughly cleansing that the breath was stolen from Bob, such that he had to gasp in reply. <nl>The chalice shattered into a thousand pieces, the ruby shards scattering everywhere. But as Bob watched in horror, the chalice slowly reformed itself, the scarlet gem floating back into place.<nl><nl> ""You, it was you..."" Bob said. ""You were the one who took it away. You were the one who robbed me of my hunger to sunder the world. All those times that you demanded my attention, that you distracted me from my research, it was you who led me astray..."" <nl> Winston frowned, and he had to stop himself from growling. ""I wouldn't put it that way,"" he said. ""I brought to you many things which you never had before in your life. Company, solace, friendship, all those things denied to you because of your lineage. I made you care for something other than just yourself, and in the process you learned more about life, and why it is worth preserving, did you not?"" <nl> Bob leapt to his feet, then swept the scrolls and books off the table in a rage. ""I asked for none of that! I only decided to let you live because you looked as pitiful as I was, all those years ago when I was abandoned at the Academy! I thought it would be just the two of us, in our quest to rule the world! How was I to know that you were a festering demon, sapping my ambition, my desire, from the shadows!"" <nl> Bob grabbed a rubied chalice, flung it at Winston. The ornament bounced off the edges of the circle, sizzling sparks at the point of contact. <nl> ""How was I to know that you were a foul Demon of Contentment!"" yelled Bob. <nl> Winston waited as his master sobbed. Minutes passed, and if he were a first-year demon, wet behind the ears, still brimming with enthusiasm with every human he corrupted, he would likely have wrongly believed he would be banished. <nl> But Winston was a seasoned demon, one of the most dangerous ones to lurk the underworld. And so he made his move, just as he had practiced over the countless millennia. <nl> ""Master,"" he said, when he judged the time was right. ""As long as I am with you, I doubt that you'll ever push yourself the way you did back at the Academy. I also doubt you'll attain your dream of ruling the world before 40, as you swore you would. But I assure you, the days will be fruitful, the nights will bring peace, and you will never want for anything you cannot easily achieve. Happiness, master, is only a few steps away. Come, the circle needs smudging."" <nl> Bob eventually moved from his seat, and with the edge of his shoe, scrubbed away the edges of the circle, breaking the containment spell. <nl> Winston leapt into his master's arms, licking Bob's face over and over again. <nl> He hadn't liked it when men had first called him a demon, much less so when any of his masters ever blamed him for things he didn't feel he deserved. But if it meant that he could spend more time with some of these humans, who clearly lacked for the things which he could give, then he supposed it was worth it. <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>

His childhood was troubled, and things only seemed to get worse for him as time went on. It was as if he was cursed, doomed to endure. <nl> At the core of all his anguish was his family; his dreadful, detestable family. All of them seemed truly evil - each like the embodiment of the deadly sin they most treasured. <nl> He'd managed to run away from them, not too long ago; but far too late. The damage was done. <nl> So when he heard the news that his family suddenly passed away, he expected to feel exalted. Ecstatic. Like all the torment could finally end. <nl> Instead, he just felt hollower than he'd ever been. <nl> And yet, he was homeless, and the sole heir to the family house. It pained him go back there, but he had no choice. No one wanted to buy the house, that was for sure. <nl> So he returned to his nightmare place, feeling more trapped now than his year of being on the streets. <nl> **** <nl> The demons watched him arrive with trepidation. They were used to corrupting men, to influencing them to do the most terrible things. But this young man was already broken. He had no desires to manipulate. No ironies to exert. <nl> The young man that had moved in was the most dead living being they'd ever seen. <nl> They remembered him as a child. His family had been in the house for two generations, and while all before them had been their own kind of terrible, each having evil characteristics that they could exploit - he had none of them. <nl> But he had suffered the most because of it. <nl> The demons realised that this man's life - the entirety of it, really - had been ruined by none other than themselves. He was collateral damage. Their machinations were meant to punish the wicked, not harm the good. <nl> They'd had a crisis of identity. <nl> So now, it was time for each of them to fix it. For all of them - for the first time since their inception - this was the first time they were going to do *good*. <nl>I never thought I'd see the day,"" Envy muttered, looking closely at the young man. ""But maybe this is our chance to make amends.<nl><nl> Pride stared at the young man, his hollow shuffling, his blank gaze. <nl> He turned back to face the group of demons assembled around him, sighing heavily. <nl> ""Well, we've right fucked this one up.

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> I tapped my pencil on my desk, absentmindedly. The grimoire was pretty specific about everything else. Solar eclipse, three stones of jet, time of year, incantation... it even included a pronunciation guide. Which, you know, was great because my Greek absolutely sucked. <nl> Black robes, check. Knife of cold iron with a black handle consecrated by the caster's blood, check-check-check. Sacrifice of 100 lives before the altar. Well... the book was weirdly vague about this part. Chickens or goats were usually traditional, but summoning one of the Lords of the Below was usually an instance where something more... complex and rare was required. <nl> Or was it? I thought again. This was the only thing it didn't specify. <nl> Hmmm... <nl> Three weeks passed, and it was nearly time. It was the darkest week of winter, I checked NASA's website obsessively for the peak moment of totality. I was standing in the backyard in my black robes and solar eclipse glasses in front of my dad's firepit, the grimoire laid across the picnic table. The clear winter sky bit my cheeks with vicious frostbite. God, I must have looked like a total idiot. <nl> I kinda had to improvise a little bit, but I got as much of the setting right as I could. I ended up cobbing the black salt pentacle by putting my old charcoal pencils in a blender with some dirt from my gerbil's grave and a half a can of table salt. The black candles were leftovers from a Halloween clearance sale, and the other decor was similarly somewhat improvised. <nl> But hey. If I was going to get my crazy, bitchy stepmom out of the house for good, I had to be a little discreet with my stuff. She was at the church Ladies' Committee until 7 o'clock tonight, and dad was working a double. Part of me wondered if it was to get away from her. <nl>I raised an eyebrow. ""Something more rare, I presume?<nl><nl> I eyed the petri dish in my left hand. I sneaked it out of my biology class earlier that day. Originally, I'd been planning on using feeder goldfish or crickets from the petstore, but that would have involved asking my stepmom for money and a ride. Which would have required an explanation. This was the best I could do. <nl> I clicked on my bluetooth speaker and let the ominous sounding drums clear my head. Usually, whenever I did ritual, things were more improvised and less elaborate. Especially given the prying eyes of my stepmom. But this was important. With the practice of dozens of meditations, I cleared my mind and recited the chant. I walked the circle, I measured my steps, I bit my lip as I pricked my finger with the blade of my knife. I lit the candles, I lit the fire, the incense, and tossed the herbs into the flame. I raised my hands, finishing the incantation as I slashed my knife across the petri dish, dumping it into the fire. I buried my knife hilt-deep into the frozen ground and called the demon's name. <nl> The moon covered the sun. It didn't go dark like I thought it would. I looked up. The sky was noticeably dimmer. My ears rang, my head buzzed. The shadows of the bare branches of our tree shed crescent-shaped umbral specters on our fence. Totality. <nl> A huge gust of wind swirled around me, a dust devil whipping the air that sputtered out the candles and scattered snow and black salt in the air like a 3-second blizzard. And just as suddenly as it began, it stopped. <nl> My music had stopped. The pulse in my ears was the only drum I heard. I held my breath, my half-frozen hand clenched around the hilt of my knife, the blade buried deep in the cold hard dirt and snow. The campfire flickered in front of me. And then, suddenly, it too extinguished. <nl> Dammit. I screwed up. Just as I stood up, I heard a soft voice behind me. Cool as vodka, smooth as granite. ""Well, points for creativity. Usually, people use mice."" <nl> I whirled around. No one was there. ""So."" The voice continued. ""You want your stepmother to leave your father. I think that can be arranged. But you have to do something for me first."" <nl> Part two further in the comments. <eos>

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> Down below her, she could hear the bells ringing in the town. She knew she was desperate, coming here, but up in the mountains, gold was getting scarce. All the bigger and older dragons had massive hoards, and trying to wrest a single, ancient coin away from the other dragons was liable to wind up with her getting soundly beat. There were no more ancient barrows or lost temples up in the mountains that hadn't been picked clean by the other dragons. A lot of the younger ones had come down to the hills and plains, trying to take gold from humans or dwarves. A few had even tried to strike down the elves, but between the excellent elven archers, and the fact that most elves in this region are more inclined towards living wild and free, rather than rich and decadently, they wound up getting very little for their trouble, besides arrow wounds. <nl> But she'd been listening from a distance to some of those bothersome lesser races that sometimes come around to try and drive some of the other young dragons away, or perhaps kill them. She had mostly listened because their troubadour sang very beautifully, and to know if they were hunting her. But when they spoke to one another, they spoke of something called a ''quest''. A form of task, given to you at something called an ''Adventurers' Guild''. And if you completed this task, you were given gold. <nl> Gold, which is what all dragons desire. For a number of reasons. Mostly for purposes of social hierarchy. A dragon with more gold is respected, while one with little gold is considered a nuisance, and is usually expected to obey richer dragons, or face social exclusion. And since these mortals get paid in gold for doing tasks, she reasoned that she too could get paid for doing these quests. Certainly sounded easier than trying to dig up the burial mounds of dead kings, or stealing it from mortals. <nl> It was early morning when she landed in front of the building, which had a sign outside of it proclaiming it to be the local offices of the Guild of Heroes, Adventurers, and Associated Trades. She had flown above the town for a couple of days before she'd gone down there, having observed how these quests worked. Outside of the guild building, there was a large place for posting various tasks. Some adventurers, usually in groups of four or five, took a piece of paper from the board, and then walked inside the building. So she did essentially the same. She landed in front of the board, and picked one that sounded feasible. Capture or kill the centaur highwayman Artonak. She wasn't too big, so she could still fit through the main door of the building. The people on the other side were dumbstruck by her sudden appearance. <nl> She looked around, ''*I want to do this quest thing. Bring in a bandit? Yes. I get paid in gold?*'' A gnome, who had fallen on his back when she'd walked in got up and looked at her incredulously. ''*But you're a dragon?*'' She nodded. ''*Yes. You pay in gold for centaur highwayman?*'' She handed the gnome the piece of paper detailing the quest. The gnome then turned to his the other people and started a conversation with them, speaking hurriedly. Her common wasn't good enough to follow the conversation that the gnome had with the other people in there. But when she coughed, they all turned back to her with obvious terror. <nl> ''*Uh. Yes. We'll pay for Artonak in gold. The bastard has been hitting merchants and travellers for months. Supposedly his lair is somewhere in the hills outside of town*'' Happy to have been proven correct, she was about to back out of the building before the gnome spoke up hurriedly again. ''*Uh, you just have to register as an adventurer first.*'' She thought it over, and nodded. She didn't exactly understand the language enough, but the staff at the building managed to make her understand that she needed to tell them who she was, and write down her name on a piece of very small paper, otherwise she would not get the gold. She signed as Teristrolkanovy de Wrelros'Dai, which was only the first part of her name. She might not entirely understand what they talking about, but she recognised a contract when she saw one, and no dragon ever reveals their full name. <nl> After that, she bolted, and flew away, following the highway out of town. And from above, it was a lot easier to spot where the centaur was setting up a trap for a stagecoach. As he kicked down a partially felled tree in front of the horses, and jumped out with crossbows in his hands, she swept down and grasped him in her claws. The shocked centaur dropped his crossbows, and the sheer shock of her sudden swooping attack, allowed her to completely disarm him, using a tactic her parents had taught her when dealing with armoured knights on armoured horses. <nl> When she landed again, the centaur was completely stripped naked, and also in deep shock. She'd landed in front of the guildhouse, where a number of armoured adventurers, and the staff from inside of the building were standing, and talking in very heated tones. Those were silenced when she landed, and placed the centaur in front of the gnome that had talked to her earlier. ''*Please give money.*'' The adventurers had all drawn forth a truly astonishing amount of rare and unusual weaponry when she landed. But the staff explained that since she'd brought in her first quest target, she was technically an adventurer. And since she'd brought in an outlaw, she wasn't an enemy. <nl> The adventurers all sheathed their weapons, and the gnome fetched her prize. 200 gold pieces. Which was a lot more gold pieces than she'd thought, as she was still very new to the business. She placed the gold in the crudely crafted bag she carried on her back, which contained the only things she'd owned before getting kicked out of her parents' cave. Which consisted of a large and worn velvet blanket, a breastplate with a mirror enchantment on it, allowing her to look at herself in it, woolly earmuffs made from woolly mammoth, and a toy rabbit. <nl> She had many questions about more quests, and eventually, the guild staff had to bring in a translator, as her questions got more complicated, and so did the answers. They explained to her how adventurers travelled between towns, doing quests, helping people, and how it was important that she circled around in the region. Which they had added because if they didn't she'd probably stop anything bigger than goblins on her own, leaving most of that town's resident adventurers out of a job. <nl>'She had many questions about more quests, and eventually, the guild staff had to bring in a translator, as her questions got more complicated, and so did the answers.

Happy with having earned the first part of her hoard, she flew on to the next town, where the locals were equally confused and worried about a young dragon swooping in and accepting quests. They were quite happy when she managed to track down a band of slavers, kill them, and bring back the people they'd taken in raids. <nl> That town too sent her on, and like a knight errant, she travelled from town to town, earning a lot of gold, till her backpack was swollen. She was worried about suddenly having to leave her gold behind, but having learned more about the common speech, she enquired with the guild, and discovered a new concept, new to dragons at least. Banks. Put your hoard inside of a vault, lock the door, and it'd be safe. So she happily deposited her hoard, especially after they explained how compound interest worked. <eos>

Return that number only. Do not return any other information in your response. Story: <sos> I turned the T.V. off and listened to the soft blowing wind from the cracked window next to me. I slid it closed as the words rolled over me, their meaning slowly taking hold. <nl> ""Military aid is unavailable,"" the grim-faced man said before wishing everyone that could hear his voice good luck as the station went back to the crawling white letters over the black screen. Normally the screen would have an accompanied several loud screeches that made my ears want to bleed, but not tonight. <nl> For a few moments I stared at the blank screen, mouth slightly agape, my eyebrows coming together. The broadcast felt like a joke, some elaborate prank on the city. Something to be ignored, laughed at for a passing moment before you got back to your life. As the words settled in me something else bloomed; fear. Anxiety. Tension that busied my hands with the hem of my shirt as the sounds from across the street at the Stevenson house flowed into my ears. <nl> I could see the party starting up, hear the laughing and the overly loud talking. Behind the two-story house I could see the sun kissing the horizon, staining the sky in pinks and oranges that seeped lower and grew darker with each passing second. I watched a car pull up to the already cluttered curb and park, a pair of nicely dressed women stumbling out with drunken giggles. I watched them trek through the freshly mowed lawn and knock on the front door, a crisp red. I watched until the light that spilled out through the doorway was cut off and turned back to my empty house. <nl> Barricading the doors was easy enough and for once I was thankful for all the extra supplies from the do-it-yourself kitchen renovation my one time brother-in-law has insisted upon. I had just enough wood for the doors and most of the windows. By the time I hammered in that last nail, securing the piece of pale wood in place, the sun was gone and the sky was dark. The realization hit me harder than words can describe. <nl> The words of that anchor came to mind. ""Do not make any light or noise between 6 P.M. and 8 A.M.,"" and a new kind of fear sent my heart thrashing behind the cage of bone. I could taste each quick beat; salty pennies with the burn of bile from my churning stomach. <nl> The clock on the stove, those bright red numbers, read 7:42 P.M. My mouth dried out with a breath. How had the time gone so quickly? I hurried over the tiled floor and covered the numbers with a hand towel, taping it in place with a strip of duct tape. No light. <nl> Each light on the bottom floor clicked off with a soft sound that I felt the entire world could hear. With the last little sound I stood in the dark  living room and waited. For what? Death? My mind showed me monsters, creatures from worlds I'll never know. Horrible beasts with sharp teeth and strong jaws. Things with knives for fingers that long to bathe in my blood. I stood there conjuring up every kind of terrible sight and could still hear the party across the street. <nl> It sounded like things were kicking into high gear. Music throbbed, vibrating the world around it the home. The voices from the yard, both back and front, seeped through my walls hitting my ears muffled and slurred. A delighted scream sent me stomping up the stairs and to my bedroom and to the window pointing out to the neighborhood below. <nl> An impossibly tall and thin figure wrenched a wriggling woman towards the sidewalk. She screamed and giggled and seemed to lightly hit at the figure that kept pulling her along like she weighed less than a feather. No one at the party seemed to mind, or seemed to take much notice at all. The figure took the hits and kept walking, and walking, until they were past the boundaries of my picture window. The next scream I heard wasn't playful, or fun. It was loud, shrill, and filled with pain. <nl> It sent a spurt of adrenaline through my legs that twitched my calves, made me want to move, to help, to do anything but sit and watch those shadow covered bodies like they were some kind of T.V. show. But I didn't. I didn't help and I didn't move. Not when the screams suddenly cut off mid-sound, and not when that figure strolled back to the party, moving among the bodies like water between rocks. <nl> When the second figure moved into the crowd, ducking through the open front door to get inside, I backed away from the window. I backed up until my legs hit the edge of my bed, I moved around it until my fingertips brushed over her bedside table. I guess it was my bedside table, now. They both were. I couldn't stop the thoughts from flooding my mind, the questions. Was she safe? Were both of them? Did they catch the warning or were they doing something else at the time or were they too busy unpacking in their new home? <nl>I watched a car pull up to the already cluttered curb and park, a pair of nicely dressed women stumbling out with drunken giggles. I watched them trek through the freshly mowed lawn and knock on the front door, a crisp red.""<nl><nl> That question pushed me down the stairs as quick and as silent as I can manage on wood steps, and to the front door. Through the cracks I could hear more blood-chilling screams that raised every little hair on my body. They were close. So close. Just beyond the thick wood, calling me forth. Calling me for help. <nl> I'm not a brave person, and I've never claimed to be such, but walking away from those screams, those terrified and agony filled sounds, brought such a wave of shame over me I thought I might fall through the earth and shoot out the other side at such a speed I'd be launched into the void of space. I didn't fall but I did stumble over my own feet. <nl> My shoulder hit the wall and sent a picture to the ground, the one from our trip to Alaska all those years ago. We wanted to see the northern lights, but only saw a lot of grey clouds and snow. The glass pane shattered over our smiling faces sending specks of sharp glitter to the hardwood floor. Each tiny shine seemed to be a wailing siren that singled my existence like a beacon in the night. When everything settled I stood frozen again. Listening. Waiting. <nl> Nothing came. Not that night. And in the morning I saw them, their bodies, littering the nearly trimmed yards of the neighborhood, left behind like discarded scraps. I could see some of them from my window. Blood that clung to grass, the sidewalk, the street, caught the early morning light and gave a dull shine. Some patches looked fresh while others were dark and brown, dry or something close to it. Limbs lay scattered like confetti, parts I couldn't discern lay in heaps. Seeing the carnage I still worked up the courage to leave the house, somehow. I had to know it wasn't part of a prank, that it was real. I had to know. <nl> I tied a couple sheets together, and to my bed, pulling the knots tight before opening the window. If it didn't hold the fall wouldn't kill me, probably, but I'd have to get the ladder from the shed out back. The dark shed. If tunnels were bad would all dark places be, as well? I shook the question away, storing it for later and pushed the screen out of the windowsill. It landed with a small sound and I leaned over the edge. <nl> It held, my makeshift rope. And I reached the yard with aching shoulders. A body lay in my near my driveway. Rich tawny skin glowing in the golden sunlight, deep black hair spread out around a bloody face. Camilla Greer from two houses down lay on her back, her black dress slick and torn to rags over her stomach. Bile kissed my tongue when I saw she was hollowed out, her meat and organs gone without a trace. Then I noticed her arm, barely clinging to the rest of her body with only a string of muscle. <nl> A gasp left me, echoed by someone down the block. Mr. Lok. Omar. The richly colored robe he wore, red with gold accents, hung loosely around his body, the sash laying near the steps of his porch. The thick cloth dragged behind him, through the stained grass, catching a couple times on the rough sidewalk as he stumbled over the edge of the curb into the street. <nl> I heard his quick breaths before he emptied his stomach next to a piece of glistening gore, and I watched him wipe tears from his wrinkled face. I watched him and heard others, all around us, waking and leaving their homes, taking in the horror that stained the neighborhood, one renowned for its safety. I watched them all as they remembered the parting words of that news anchor, the words that slid through my mind. <nl> ""Military aid is unavailable. Good luck."" <nl> It wasn't a joke, it wasn't a prank. It was real, and no one was coming to save us. <eos>
