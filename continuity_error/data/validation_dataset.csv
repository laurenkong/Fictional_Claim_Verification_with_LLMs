"<sos> ""Don't you ever get lonely?"" I turn to find Tim seated next to me, an ice-cream in his hands. I ignore him, like what I have been doing for the past few weeks, and lean back unto the bench. The sun is slowly rising beyond the horizon, covering the water in its gentle sparkle. <nl> Tim, however, could never take a hint. He inches closer to me, perhaps thinking that a closer physical contact may make me more receptive to him. ""I heard from the ice-cream man that you've been around for centuries now. How old are you exactly?"" <nl> Normally, I would have walked away from busybodies like Tim, but I am feeling generous today. I tilt me head towards Tim. ""About ten to fifteen thousand years old, give or take."" <nl> He almost choked on his ice-cream. ""Are you serious? You have been waiting for your soulmate for so long?"" <nl> I smile at his question, before turning back to the sight before me. Tim is not the first to ask me that question and frankly, I never quite really know how to answer it. In our world, one tends to stop aging at thirty, remaining so until one finds their soulmate. <nl> Those who tend to be more romantic will end up finding theirs relatively early, embarking on grand quests just to find the one, while the more independent ones tend to wait around longer, between a couple of decades to centuries. There used to be those who wait for several millenniums, but with the advent of technology, millenniums have been few and far between. Me, on the other hand, is an extremely special case, for many reasons. <nl> ""We've gotta help you find your soulmate then!"" Tim suddenly blurts out. His ice-cream is gone. He is busy looking on his phone, browsing through SoulmateFinder.com, the site created for those who prefer a quicker way to finding their soulmate. <nl> I place my hand above Tim's. ""Please, don't bother."" I never believed in depending on technology, anyway. To me, it constituted cheating. <nl> Tim looks at me with a confused face. ""But... but, why? Everyday I see you here, looking at the sea, alone."" <nl> ""Oh, I am finding alright,"" I tell him as I stand. ""It's just that I prefer to take things slow."" <nl> ""But why?"" Tim asks. I spot the ring on this finger, and chuckles. Young people like him would never understand. They are so impatient, so eager for instant results. <nl> I tilt my hat at Tim.

"<sos> It was a relatively simple deal, and I had no reason to push the issue. One game, winner takes my soul. I nodded. <nl> ""Good. So then, what do you want to play? Think carefully - the stakes are high, and you don't want to have regrets."" <nl> It was almost as if she wanted to give me another decade - but it could also be a trick to lure me into a false sense of security. I wasn't wholly prepared for this, truth be told - but I couldn't let her win. <nl> I wracked my brain thinking of a game. I had enjoyed video games over the last decade or so, but they were presumably easier with practice, and if death existed, he - well, she - had an eternity. This also ruled out the classics - checkers, go, chess - as she was probably so much more experienced than I am at them. <nl> What about Monopoly? House rules, however, were an easy way to lose that, and I'm frankly not sure if I remembered all of the rules. Besides, that may take 10 years itself. <nl> There was no game that was a safe bet. Most had too much chance. Swinging heavily into that - like Chutes & Ladders - would just bore Death and become a 'who can cheat best' competition. And I imagine Death had Lady Luck on her side. <nl> ""Come on, now, you don't have forever..."" <nl> I decided to go for broke. <nl> ""OK - what is your favorite game?"" <nl> ""What?"" She seemed taken aback. <nl> ""I don't know what type of games you play. I don't have any knowledge to choose something where I have an advantage, and I have no reason to believe I can beat you at anything. Given that, I might as well at least let you enjoy the game."" <nl> She scoffed, but then the weirdest feeling washed over me. I had never felt a smile without seeing it, but it felt... relaxed. <nl> ""I like simple games - ones with an element of chance, but also a fairness to them. So how about... a shell game?"" <nl> I nodded again. That seems simple enough. <nl> On the bedside tray, three ebony cups materialized. You would think that Death would have ancient chalices; these were nearly perfect, non-reflective, and almost hurt to look at. It felt slightly like my eyes were broken. Of course, that might just be old age creeping up. <nl> She brought her bony hands up. ""As you can see, I have one red and two white balls. Take them."" <nl> I was surprised for a moment, then realized her variant. ""Ah, so I get to place them in the cups?"" <nl> ""Exactly - then I move them, and you must find the red one. I'll leave the room."" <nl> She stepped outside. <nl> An easy way to try to cheat would have simply been to hold the red ball, but that would have been easy to detect, and I didn't want her to have the satisfaction. I simply put the red ball in the left cup and the whites in the other two. ""OK!"" <nl> She came back in. ""OK. You can watch if you want. It may or may not help you - but I assure you I can go much faster if I wanted."" <nl> With blinding speed, she weaved the cups back and forth. It wasn't superhuman, but watching that cup was hard. I was certain I still had it, however, and made my selection - the right-most cup. <nl> She placed her hand on mine. ""Before you lift the cup, let me 'Monty Hall' it."" She placed her other hand on the center cup, and pulled it off the table - it disappeared in a puff of smoke. ""Now, do you still want your cup?"" <nl> I nodded. This was my choice, I was certain. <nl> ""Fine."" She pulled the other cup away into another cloud of smoke, then removed her cold hand from my own. ""Claim your prize."" <nl> I lifted the cup - slowly, as if I was scared. I wasn't. <nl> Until I saw what was under the cup. <nl> ""No. NO! That's not right!"" <nl> Death chuckled. This was a different sensation washing over me - it felt as if I had no control over anything. <nl> ""Those were the terms. You find the red ball, you get ten more years of earthly freedom."" <nl> I stared intently at the red ball on the table. ""No! I was certain it was a white one. Let me see the oth- you removed them!"" <nl> ""Well, unless you have proof that I cheated, I'm afraid you'll have to abide by the terms of our agreement."" <nl> I began to protest, but everything went dark. <nl> I woke up in the hospital bed - I couldn't tell if I had been asleep for days or seconds. <nl> The red ball sat on the tray, mocking me. I picked it up to hurl it away - stiff and sore, but very much alive - and I felt a slosh in my hand. I broke the ball open, and inside was a red liquid, a paper inner layer, and a thin membrane inside that. She HAD cheated, and the proof had been right in front of me. <nl> I hurled the remnants of the ball across the room, then did the same with the small, empty vial. The poison should have done the trick, and did - but then I was fooled. <nl> A nurse heard my commotion and came in. She didn't move to restrain me, but she did gently press me back into the bed. ""Mr. Karcher, please... I don't know if you can understand me, but if you can, please calm down. I understand that the dementia is confusing, but you will only keep any of your faculties if you calm down."" <nl> I relaxed, and she looked over at the tray. <nl> ""Who left this note?"" <nl> I looked at her and the note she held, with a more honest confusion than I'd had in weeks - at least, up until a few moments ago. <nl> ""'Don't play games with me - you might win. Cheers, D' Well, whoever it was has impeccable penmanship."" She showed me the note. ""There's even a little smiley face. Well, I'm not sure who came to visit you, but hopefully they'll visit again. I'll leave the note here."" <nl> Satisfied, she left. All I could do was glare at the note, and know that I had to wait at least 10 years for a return visit. <eos>

"<sos> Eric the Weak. <nl> That's what they called me. <nl> I wasn't a coward - I was just... Well, a scrawny lad. <nl> The Obsidian War has lasted more than five years, and I've killed a single Orc in battle. <nl> A single one. <nl> Oh, I've slain countless Men - tall men, short men, evil men, good men. I've even slain women, two years ago, when we were at war with the A'Zkuh-Inda'll clans far beyond our northern border. <nl> I've spent most of my war years battling in the North and East - the Orcish kingdoms layed out West, where my brothers have fallen, one by one, over the years. <nl> I was the last one left. <nl> My father, still a strong man, a wise ruler, recalled me from the eastern marshes. <nl> ""Hand-to-hand combat. You can end this war, son. You must end this war."" his face glimmered under the scorching twin Suns of Alium. <nl> ""Iron only."" he added. <nl> See, we were a family of mages. Spellswords. Witches and sorcerers. That's how we kept hold on our lands - magic was rare and feared by all. <nl> I've never killed anyone with a sword or a spear before the Battle at Frysian Planes - I've used fire. <nl> I've vanquished my enemies by the hundreds with a single wave of my hand. <nl> I relied on my magic so much that I've forgot how to wield a sword - which is why I trembled in fear when I first saw the Orc. <nl> Green giant, bloody, missing an eye and covered with countless scars. <nl> Frysia was a hellish place, a desert of black ice littered with corpses of Orcs and Men. That's where I battled the Champion of the Tribes of Irgmoorgh, a confederation of orcish tribes numbering millions. <nl> That's where I won. <nl> I know what you must be thinking - I've used magic. I didn't. <nl> It was pure, unrelenting luck. By the Gods of Alium, it was mad, insane luck. <nl> It did not end the war, though. It raged on for at least a year, until the new treaty was signed with blood. <nl> Marriage. <nl> ""You killed my brother."" were the first words she ever spoke to me, while laying in bed made of dragon-bones, deep in the windy, damp halls of the Ignis-Helicon, the capital of my father's Empire. <nl> She was shorter than I am, adorned with muscles and crimson tattoos. <nl> ""I forgive you."" she whispered, crying. <nl> There I was. <nl> A cold-blooded killer, a demigod among Men - hugging my bride, and not having a slightest clue on how to comfort women. <nl> Most of my encounters with them were either short visits to brothels before a battle was to be fought - or in the form of screeching, hellish creatures charging at me with an axe in each hand. <nl> ""It was luck. He was a better warrior than I am."" I replied. <nl> ""There is no such thing as luck. Only strength."" she spoke, again. <nl> Weeping. <nl> ""And yet... You Orcs have the concept of forgiveness. How... How can you even look at me?"" I asked, moving her fiery hair from her face. <nl> I wouldn't call her ugly. I wouldn't call her beautiful either. <nl> Cute, in a strange, strange way. <nl> A kiss followed. Then another. <nl> We stopped fornicating three days later, after a continuous march that tested my stamina unlike anything ever before. <nl> Sleep and fuck, that's all we did. <nl> It was magnificent. <nl> She was magnificent. Almost elvish in appearance, save for the untamed eyebrows, warrior-like posture and vividly colored areolas, unlike any elvish women I've ever seen naget. <nl> She was gorgeous. <nl> When Ignis-O'ferion, a colossal city up north faced starvation, she spent a third of her fortune to purchase food for its denizens. Carts filled with wheat flocked into the city for months. <nl> When my mother died, she brought my father back from the dead, constantly summoning smiles to his face with her hilarious singing and bizzare jokes. <nl> When I've almost died when battling the Ash'Ilari nomads in the south, she nursed me back to health. She was the one that pulled the arrows from my thigh and my arm, and fought off dozens while dragging me to safety. <nl> When a sick, stray kitten found its way to our castle she took care of it for a full year, feeding it by hand every time, and cried herself to sleep for months after the little fur ball died. <nl> She still weeps, sometimes. <nl> Mostly, she laughs - at my stupid jokes, at her own stupid jokes. <nl> GODS! <nl> The way she cooks. Things she can do with only a few vegetables and a rabbit can make a man cry out of sheer happiness. <nl> To be honest, I wasn't that happy when she served me a cooked rat, now something we both tend to laugh about. <nl> ""I'm with child."" she whispered to my ear, years after our wedding night. <nl> I've casted a single spell and whispered back. <nl> ""It's a boy. We'll call him Yar-Lurbuk."" <nl> She smiled. <nl> *** <eos>

You can end this war, son. You must end this war."" his face glimmered under the scorching twin Suns of Alium. <nl> ""Iron only."" he added. <nl> See, we were a family of mages. Spellswords. Witches and sorcerers. That's how we kept hold on our lands - magic was rare and feared by all. <nl> I've never killed anyone with a sword or a spear before the Battle at Frysian Planes - I've used fire. <nl> I've vanquished my enemies by the hundreds with a single wave of my hand. <nl> I relied on my magic so much that I've forgot how to wield a sword - which is why I trembled in fear when I first saw the Orc. <nl> Green giant, bloody, missing an eye and covered with countless scars. <nl> Frysia was a hellish place, a desert of black ice littered with corpses of Orcs and Men. That's where I battled the Champion of the Tribes of Irgmoorgh, a confederation of orcish tribes numbering millions. <nl> That's where I won. <nl> I know what you must be thinking - I've used magic. I didn't. <nl> It was pure, unrelenting luck. By the Gods of Alium, it was mad, insane luck. <nl> It did not end the war, though. It raged on for at least a year, until the new treaty was signed with blood. <nl> Marriage. <nl> ""You killed my brother."" were the first words she ever spoke to me, while laying in bed made of dragon-bones, deep in the windy, damp halls of the Ignis-Helicon, the capital of my father's Empire. <nl> She was shorter than I am, adorned with muscles and crimson tattoos. <nl> ""I forgive you."" she whispered, crying. <nl>I relied on my magic so much that I've forgot how to wield a sword - which is why I trembled in fear when I first saw the Orc.""<nl><nl> There I was. <nl> A cold-blooded killer, a demigod among Men - hugging my bride, and not having a slightest clue on how to comfort women. <nl> Most of my encounters with them were either short visits to brothels before a battle was to be fought - or in the form of screeching, hellish creatures charging at me with an axe in each hand. <nl> ""It was luck. He was a better warrior than I am."" I replied. <nl> ""There is no such thing as luck. Only strength."" she spoke, again. <nl> Weeping. <nl> ""And yet... You Orcs have the concept of forgiveness. How... How can you even look at me?"" I asked, moving her fiery hair from her face. <nl> I wouldn't call her ugly. I wouldn't call her beautiful either. <nl> Cute, in a strange, strange way. <nl> A kiss followed. Then another. <nl> We stopped fornicating three days later, after a continuous march that tested my stamina unlike anything ever before. <nl> Sleep and fuck, that's all we did. <nl> It was magnificent. <nl> She was magnificent. Almost elvish in appearance, save for the untamed eyebrows, warrior-like posture and vividly colored areolas, unlike any elvish women I've ever seen naget. <nl> She was gorgeous. <nl> When Ignis-O'ferion, a colossal city up north faced starvation, she spent a third of her fortune to purchase food for its denizens. Carts filled with wheat flocked into the city for months. <nl> When my mother died, she brought my father back from the dead, constantly summoning smiles to his face with her hilarious singing and bizzare jokes. <nl> When I've almost died when battling the Ash'Ilari nomads in the south, she nursed me back to health. She was the one that pulled the arrows from my thigh and my arm, and fought off dozens while dragging me to safety. <nl> When a sick, stray kitten found its way to our castle she took care of it for a full year, feeding it by hand every time, and cried herself to sleep for months after the little fur ball died. <nl> She still weeps, sometimes. <nl> Mostly, she laughs - at my stupid jokes, at her own stupid jokes. <nl> GODS! <nl> The way she cooks. Things she can do with only a few vegetables and a rabbit can make a man cry out of sheer happiness. <nl> To be honest, I wasn't that happy when she served me a cooked rat, now something we both tend to laugh about. <nl> ""I'm with child."" she whispered to my ear, years after our wedding night. <nl> I've casted a single spell and whispered back. <nl> ""It's a boy. We'll call him Yar-Lurbuk."" <nl> She smiled. <nl> *** <eos>

"<sos> It is my birthday today and I am turning 17. My friends and I are sitting at a communal table in the Nutrient Room at Hive 5778. Everyone in 5778 has turned 17 or will turn 17 with in the month; its how we are grouped. I have lived all of my life in 5778, and so has everyone I know. <nl> I have never been outside the fence of the hive as everything we need is here. If we get sick, our Mentors heal us. If we need something, our mentors will provide it. <nl> I  asked my mentors for a birthday cake this year. It is a novelty to have something sweet and as non-nutritious as cake. Sure enough, when our meals come, mine has a little piece of colorful cake in the corner of my tray. Of course, the rest of my food had a smaller portion in order to accommodate the extra calories of the cake; everyone has their own special food designed specifically for their current needs. <nl> As soon as I finished eating my birthday dinner, my brainMentor switched on: *Go to Mentor office C-77b.* <nl> This was not unexpected. Everyone who turned 17 had a personal visit to a Mentor. C-77b was my Mentor. He seemed kinder than the other's I had met. <nl> I told my friends I had to go and walked out of the Nutrient Room. I walked to Hive Central and took the hall labeled C. My Mentor had an office about half way down the kM long hall. <nl> I stopped outside the closed door and waited. A red light blinked on over the door and seconds later the door retracted and I stepped into the empty white room. As soon as I made it inside, the door closed again. <nl> **SIT DOWN.** <nl> As he gave his command a chair grew from the floor and I sat. <nl> ""What can I do for you R2-D2?"" I asked. The other Mentors are called by their office number. I called mine R2-D2 because I saw a movie (a special treat for my 10th birthday) that featured a robot with the name.

",As he gave his command a chair grew from the floor and I sat.<nl>,2,"<sos> It is my birthday today and I am turning 17. My friends and I are sitting at a communal table in the Nutrient Room at Hive 5778. Everyone in 5778 has turned 17 or will turn 17 with in the month; its how we are grouped. I have lived all of my life in 5778, and so has everyone I know. <nl> I have never been outside the fence of the hive as everything we need is here. If we get sick, our Mentors heal us. If we need something, our mentors will provide it. <nl>As he gave his command a chair grew from the floor and I sat.<nl><nl> I  asked my mentors for a birthday cake this year. It is a novelty to have something sweet and as non-nutritious as cake. Sure enough, when our meals come, mine has a little piece of colorful cake in the corner of my tray. Of course, the rest of my food had a smaller portion in order to accommodate the extra calories of the cake; everyone has their own special food designed specifically for their current needs. <nl> As soon as I finished eating my birthday dinner, my brainMentor switched on: *Go to Mentor office C-77b.* <nl> This was not unexpected. Everyone who turned 17 had a personal visit to a Mentor. C-77b was my Mentor. He seemed kinder than the other's I had met. <nl> I told my friends I had to go and walked out of the Nutrient Room. I walked to Hive Central and took the hall labeled C. My Mentor had an office about half way down the kM long hall. <nl> I stopped outside the closed door and waited. A red light blinked on over the door and seconds later the door retracted and I stepped into the empty white room. As soon as I made it inside, the door closed again. <nl> **SIT DOWN.** <nl> As he gave his command a chair grew from the floor and I sat. <nl> ""What can I do for you R2-D2?"" I asked. The other Mentors are called by their office number. I called mine R2-D2 because I saw a movie (a special treat for my 10th birthday) that featured a robot with the name.

"<sos> **Please let me know what you think.** <nl> ""I love you."" <nl> The words kept echoing in my mind. It had been the last thing that I had heard Jack say, his eyes bright and his grin wide. <nl> And I had frozen, surprised and unable to respond. How the hell was I supposed to respond? I hadn't known Jack for as long as I could remember, but I don't think I had ever known anyone else as well as I knew Jack. And I think that Jack was easily the one who knew me best. Our friends had often teased that we would make an adorable couple, but I had always laughed it off. <nl> And the trouble was, I had meant it. I had never had any interest in Jack, even if he was handsome and funny. <nl> Thankfully for me, he had been snatched before I could figure out how to respond. One minute, he had been standing in front of me, watching me with hopeful eyes, and the next he was several feet in the air, screaming for dear life as the Wraith Lord flew away, holding firmly on to his hostage. I had nearly cried with relief. I had never been good at thinking under pressure. I had just decided to slink away, when Isobel had arrived and tried to slap some sense into me. <nl> ""He's your soul mate,"" she had wailed. ""He confessed his love for you. You can't just let him get taken!"" <nl> The slapping part had been perfect. My cheeks still stung at the memory. But it wouldn't have been enough to convince me to follow a dark sorcerer to his lair. Unfortunately, Isobel had good aim and sturdy boots. I was sure that my shin was still bruised with the force of Isobel's kicking. <nl> Even now, I was tempted to slip away as quietly as I could. I could only think about Jack's bright, hopeful eyes and having to tell him that I didn't feel the same way. Surely, I reflected, it would be kinder to leave him in the clutches of the Wraith Lord than to break his heart. <nl> Yes, I thought, as my mood began to pick up. I could just walk away now. It would be the humane thing to do. There was no reason I shouldn't just walk away. <nl> Something poked into my back. ""Don't you dare think about stopping."" <nl> Oh, yes. That was why I couldn't walk away. <nl> ""Isobel, please,"" I protested. ""I'm sure he'll be fine."" <nl> ""No, he won't. Not until you rescue him and confess your feelings and have a big, glorious wedding with me as your maid of honour."" <nl> ""But I don't even - Maid of honour?"" <nl> ""Oh, yes,"" Isobel burbled, as her tone abruptly became warmer and dreamier. ""I've planned it all out. You'll have a big wedding, and make us bridesmaids wear big, beautiful dresses and -"" <nl> ""But that doesn't have anything to do with Jack. Or me, for that matter."" <nl> ""Don't be silly. I can't be a maid of honour with no wedding."" The barrel of the gun poked into my back again. ""So keep walking."" <nl> Maybe I should find a way to set her up with the Wraith Lord. Two obsessive megalomaniacs together. They would either kill each other or marry each other. Either would be perfectly fine with me. <nl> /r/YarnsToTell <eos>

"<sos> The warning was clear: if you break any of the rules, you die. Lucy left the house before dawn once to gather stream water, and she never came back. We never even found a body. Alex forgot to turn the light off in his room one night before he fell asleep, and we found him in the morning; drained from within, barely a husk of a man. <nl> It was down to me and Erin in the house, a woman I barely even knew. She was Alex's friend, and prior to the lockdown, I'd only known her as the mysterious girl who showed up to crash for days at a time, always managing to eat my Pop-Tarts in the process. Now she and I were clinging desperately to the hope of rescue, but we knew that it was a vain hope. ""Military aid is unavailable,"" the message had said. No one was coming for us. <nl> The message had also said not to enter tunnels during the day, but that's exactly what Erin and I were suiting up to do. She handed me the hockey equipment we'd found in Alex's closet. He'd been a star goalie for the school team in another life. <nl> ""Are you sure about this?"" she asked as she put some of the pads on. I nodded. It had been her idea, but I didn't see much of an alternative that didn't involve sitting on my ass all day, waiting it out. I tried on Alex's mask. It fit pretty well, and I grinned behind it. *Just like Casey Jones.* <nl> ""What do we have as far as weapons?"" I asked. Erin frowned. <nl> ""Really just hockey sticks I found in his closet, but it's your house, what else you got?"" <nl> My mind went immediately to the knife block in the kitchen, though the thought of using my expensive cooking knives as weapons upset me more than a little. They'd cost me a month's rent, but they might be the most effective things I had on hand. I walked slowly into the kitchen and grabbed the large chef's knife from the block. I hadn't used it since this whole ordeal began, which meant it was still nice and sharp. I grabbed a boning knife for Erin to use just in case the hockey stick didn't prove useful. <nl> When I came back into the living room, Erin's head was bowed in prayer, her hands clasped around the cross necklace I'd always seen her wear. I allowed her a moment of silence, after which her eyes opened with a resolve I'd never seen in her. <nl> ""You ready?"" she asked. I wasn't, but I nodded anyway. <nl> We opened the door, bracing ourselves for an assault that never came. It was 2 o' clock by my watch, which meant we had a solid four hours to do our business and get back to the house before nightfall. I knew there was a cave system near the campus, thanks to an introductory archaeology course I'd taken sophomore year. That was our target. Maybe if we could find out why we were warned not to enter tunnels, we could find out what was happening. <nl> Fear rose in my chest the closer we got to the tunnels. I knew what we were doing was one of the only courses of action available to us, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't scare the piss out of me. Upon arriving at the tunnels, we peered in, unable to see past about five feet in. I gulped, taking out a flashlight I'd brought to light our way. I don't know how I could have been prepared for what I saw. <nl> Sure enough, there were figures in the tunnel, at least four, by my count. They looked humanoid, which I don't think I'd been expecting. But the most unsettling part is that they were *hanging from the ceiling.* I needed to get closer, to figure out how they were doing it. <nl> My feet slid one in front of the other, as slowly as I could manage while still making forward progress. I was close enough to reach out and touch one of the figures, though I dared not. Shining my flashlight up at the ceiling, I could see the figures all had their feet dug into the soft earth above them, and were somehow hanging from that. <nl> The closest one to me opened his eyes with a start. I stumbled backward, landing squarely on my ass. I tried my best to look intimidating as I brandished the knife I'd brought with me, but whatever it was we were facing down didn't look deterred. I could see the bloodthirst in its eyes, though the scariest thing about it was that it looked totally human, aside from skin so pale it was almost translucent. <nl> Erin cracked her hockey stick over its head, though it didn't appear to notice the injury at all. It slowly turned its eyes to her, dropping from the ceiling and drawing itself up to its full height in one smooth motion. It was taller than it had first appeared; almost as tall as the tunnel itself, some seven and a half feet. Erin recoiled, and that was all the prompting the thing needed. <nl> It lunged at her, baring fangs I could have sworn weren't there a moment before. I cried out, moving as if to stab the thing, though I was still too far away. Erin and the monster tumbled to the ground, making the muffled grunts of a struggle. Suddenly, the monster screeched, loud enough to make my ears bleed. It fell backward, clawing at the burning hole in its chest, and I saw fear in its eyes for the first time. <nl> Erin's expression was one of delighted confusion. The cross on her necklace burned with a soft light, and it suddenly clicked. <nl> ""The cross!"" I shouted at her, and her confusion gave way to determination. She stood, removing the necklace, and she approached the next sleeping vampire. <nl> *Finally,* I thought. *We can end this.* <eos>

"<sos> Not once in my life had something come to me. I had willed, wished, and pleaded with the world that the rest of my body and soul would come flying to my hand after my 18th birthday.

I've made my decision."" <nl> She frowned. ""You would be the first,"" she said, cocking her head to the side. ""It is not an easy path you wish to tread. Are you certain?"" <nl> ""Yes - it might not be easy, but that is exactly why I wish to take it! ""Do you hear me?"" I yelled, raising my head to the stars above. ""I have chosen!"" <nl> Lucifer offered forth her right hand. <nl> I took it, our contract bound. <nl> Her skin began to crack and blood dribbled down her body, as red scales thrust out and quickly covered her. Her wings began to smoulder and her lips curled into a terrible smile. <nl> There was something so dreadful about her, and yet something almost *beautiful*, too. <nl> ""*Always so easy*,"" she hissed, as my surroundings became a swirl of light that began to fade into nothingness. <nl> --- <nl> Thanks for reading.

"<sos> I slapped the sticky bar table. Adrenaline pumped in my ears. <nl> ""I'm going to do it! I'm going to talk to her!"" I announced. <nl> My buddy laughed, ""I'll believe it when I see it."" Everyone else at the table snorted into their beers. <nl> Gathering all of my courage and spontaneity I jumped up from the table and strode over to the beautiful blonde I had been gawking at all night. Her friends immediately stopped talking as I approached. <nl> ""Hi,"" I breathed. ""Can I buy you a drink?"" <nl> *This is it. All those years of my father telling me I should never take a risk. It ends now.* <nl> For a moment Beautiful Blonde stares up at me in bewilderment then her eyes soften as she smiles. <nl> ""Sure, why the hell not?"" <nl> We must have sat together for hours in easy conversation before I noticed her fiddling with a scrap of paper in her hand. She noticed me staring. <nl> ""I think scratch tickets are so stupid. I bought it on a whim but I  never win anything. Want to scratch it off together?"" <nl> My father's voice boomed in my head. <nl> *And don't even think of doing the lottery, son! We would likely get struck my lightening on the way to buying one!* <nl> I swallowed hard, fear a large lump in my throat. Before I could think I snatched the ticket out of her hand and furiously scratched away the silver. <nl> ""Whoa! Easy, killer!"" Beautiful Blonde laughed at my tenacity. Then her laughter died in her mouth as she gazed at the ticket in shock. ""Holy shit! You just won five grand!"" But the ticket didn't matter anymore. The girl didn't matter. <nl> ""Where are you going?"" She called but I was already walking out the bar. Something was finally different. All those years of living in fear of taking risks had finally ended. <nl> I hailed a cab and within the hour was dropped off at the place I had avoided for years. The hospital was quiet and brightly lit as I made my way to the Long Term Care unit. <nl> The last ten years were long listening to my father's warnings in my head. But I never actually heard him. I stood over his comatose body. I hadn't heard his voice in ten years and had stopped hoping I would. I stopped visiting. My dad would always say he had the worst of luck and his own father's luck was even worse. It came to no one's surprise in my family when he got in that car accident. His condition served as it's own cautionary tale to never try. <nl> I watched as my father's eyes began to flutter. <nl> But tonight I think my luck has changed. <eos>

"<sos> The heart rate monitors flatlined. Doctor Rex bowed over the young man. ""Shit. We need defib. STAT!"" Amanda dashed to the wall and plucked the defibrillator off its hooks. She handed the paddles to Rex. ""Clear!"" He shouted and sent bolts of lighting through the dying man. He arched and shuddered, but the monitors still read a flat line. ""Clear!"" Rex shouted again, and jolted the man. Same results. Nothing. ""One more time. Clear!"" Rex sent one final, shuddering jolt through the paddles. No results. ""Dammit. This one's gone. Too much blood loss. Amanda, call down to the meat locker? And wipe that creepy smile off your face. I swear, it's like you're turned on by this stuff."" <nl> ""Sorry! Yeah, I'm weird. Sorry.

"<sos> The clock said 4:41. <nl> I was angry. I had no business being awake at such an hour, unless I never went to sleep in the first place. Those nights are fun... or, at least that is, they were. What an awful irony. Work rolls around every morning, and you couldn't imagine any place more desirably than your own bed. But noooo, the weekend comes and suddenly your brain wants you up at the ass crack of dawn for no discernible reason. The worst of it is that now that I'm up, I'm already aware of the day's unpleansantries. My teeth are all wearing their own sweaters, my head feels like it had a one night stand with the business end of a sledgehammer, and my bladder felt as full as my bank account wasn't. <nl> 4:42 <nl> I was just about to try heading back to sleep, when I noticed a faint glow on the screen of my phone. A text message; <nl> *Overdraft Alert. This message was sent to you automatically to inform you that your account ending in 0741 was overdrawn by $322. The amount has been automatically withdrawn from your saving account ending in 6691.* <nl> Now that was strange. Sure my life hadn't exactly been something to write a book about lately, but I am a bit past the point of overdrawing my checking account... plus... what would I have spent it on? <nl> Stolen. That was the only logical explanation. My identity had been stolen. Suddenly the fact that it was way too early to be up on a Saturday didn't matter. I knew I needed to get this all sorted out. Being broke is one thing, but being *flat* broke isn't something you can work with in your 30s. <nl> I sat up ready to reach for the light, when I noticed the light in my kitchen appeared to be on already. I walked into my kitchen to discover that my sink appeared to be running as well. As if this wasn't strange enough, I couldn't help but notice that there was a black lacy bra soaking up a bath at my water bill's expense. This in and of itself was curious for two reasons; I'm typically frugal enough to make sure lights and faucets are off, and I'm a 33 year old man. I also noticed an envelope with my name and address sitting on the kitchen counter that was opened and a check sticking partially out of it. <nl> The check inside was made out to cash to the tune of $50,000,000. <nl> Yeah. Ok. <nl> There was a note on the memo line: ""Mission successful."" <nl> I mean, if you want to write a prank check to someone, maybe pick a more realistic fake dollar amount. <nl> It was at that moment that I glanced out the kitchen window. The water, lights, check, and bra were certainly strange. The most curious thing of all however, was that the sun would be up this early. <nl> Ah crap. I slept through my entire Saturday. And what the hell did I do last night? I don't remember a damn thing. I don't remember going out, but all the evidence says I did. I glanced back at my bed to make sure it was empty. After all, there was a bra in my sink. That must have come from somewhere. Also why did I leave everything on in the kitchen? Come on drunk me, you're classier than that. <nl> Well, since my problems seemed to be revealing themselves to me in alarming frequency this morning...afternoon...evening... I felt I better start addressing them. Given the fact that my bladder felt like a suit case packed by my ex-mother-in-law, I thought that might be as good a place as any to start. I walked over to the bathroom, and instinctively reached to pull down my pants only to discover that I hadn't been bothered to put any on last night. <nl> As the merciful release of last night's mistakes flowed from my body, I couldn't help but notice out of the corner of my eye that the presumed owner of my latest garment discovery appeared to be sleeping in my bathtub, wearing her purse and some heels, that I must say matched her birthday suit quite well. The thunderous current of my fire hose must have roused her slumber, as she slowly blinked open her eyes. I remember hearing the scream only faintly, before the warm sensation of burning overtook my leg and my muscles suddenly felt the urge to go on holiday. <nl> I opened my eyes slowly, with a sudden realization that I should clean my bathroom floor more often. I pushed myself up slowly, and discovered that my house guest had helped herself to one of my favorite pair of lounging shorts, thought that was as far as she'd managed to dress herself in the moments in which my brain decided to forgo consciousness. <nl> ""I'm sorry I panicked."" She said, in a voice that sounded as groggy as I felt, witha healthy dose of bitter anger thrown in for good measure. ""I don't suppose you remember where we threw my clothes last night, do you?"" <nl> I attempted to think of something witty to retort, but after running my fingers across the taser burn on my thigh, I thought it might be best to skip my usual snark. ""I think I remember seeing your bra in the sink"" I said, suddenly losing the urge to control my demeanor adding ""you can't miss it. It's right next to the check for $50,000,000."" <nl> She walked over to the kitchen, grimacing as she picked up her bra and finding that it was in no state to be worn. Even in my state of delirium, the math was starting to fill itself in as to what happened to my Friday evening and the better part of my Saturday afternoon. I thought, perhaps, my house-guest might be able to confirm some of my suspicions. <nl> ""Um, I know this sounds pretty cliche,"" I started only to be met with a scowl that could have stopped a bull elephant in it's tracks. I decided to forgo better judgement and press on in the name of scientific inquiry. ""I'm afraid I'm a little fuzzy on some of the details that led to... well... that led to where we are right now."" <nl> She slid open the kitchen window and started climbing onto the fire escape, a comical sight though I dare not say anything to invoke further wrath. She climbed back through a moment later with a rather smart dress which had found it's way outside in lord only knows what way. She slid it on over her head, continuing in a single fluid (rather impressive actually) motion to remove my shorts without further compromising her modesty, only to wad them up and throw them at me. <nl> ""You know,"" she started, ""I'll admit I knew that you were full of it, and I was willing to ignore it because I wanted to have some fun. But if you're going to pull a stunt like that again, at least fake it a little better next time"" she said picking up the check and slamming it down. She walked towards my door. She unlocked it, paused for a moment, turned around, angrily grabbed her bra off the counter, looked at the check one more time and angrily snorted ""lottery winner. Good one asshole"" before returning to the war path which led her conveniently through my door. <nl> ""Well... so much for that mystery"" I thought out loud as I chuckled at the very fake looking check. I didn't think I was the type to sink to a gimmick that low just to get a girl home, but the evidence was pretty damning. I guess in my drunken state I reeled her in with stories about winning the lottery, and decided to seal the deal by somehow acquiring a dummy check for $50,000,000 to impress her with back home. I can't believe how foolish, or perhaps brazen I was to write ""mission successful"" to myself in the memo line. That's low even by recently-divorced-in-your-30s standards. I actually felt pretty slimy. <nl> As I walked back over to the bathroom to wash myself clean of such a shameful evening, I was interrupted by a knock at the door. As I walked over to the door, I realized I owed this woman quite an apology. ""Listen,"" I started as I reached for the door, ""I really ought to apologize to you for the..."" <nl> I swung the door open to find that the attractive young woman with tossed bathtub hair I was expecting was in fact two stout men in suits who looked about as pleased to see my birthday suit was I was to show it to them. <nl> ""I see our newest agent is as discreet as we feared"" the first man said to the other. <nl> ""It doesn't matter."" the second man retorted. ""He's off the radar, and he's willing. That's all we need."" <nl> At this point I started looking around for hidden cameras, but before I could even begin to comprehend just what in the hell was happening, the men invited themselves in. <nl> ""Ah"" the first man said. ""I see the first part of our mission was successful and you have the check."" <nl> ""Good. Good."" the second man said, ""though I would have hoped you would cashed the check by now. Really adds a step to our day and we're on a timeline."" <nl> ""Well,"" I started, realizing that I was so lost about this situation that nothing I said next could possibly make sense. ""Well... it's just... you know... it's Saturday, so the banks are closed..."" <nl> I was pretty proud of that! I mean, it should buy me at least a little time, right? <nl> ""Your instructions said nothing about a bank,"" the first man said, ""and it's Sunday."" <nl> ""Now get dressed"" the second man said, ""our plane leaves the country in two hours."" <nl> [**Part 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6dk6ex/wp_you_wake_up_one_morning_to_find_an_envelope/di4bl33/) || [**Part 3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6dk6ex/wp_you_wake_up_one_morning_to_find_an_envelope/di4i5hg/) || [**Part 4**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6dk6ex/wp_you_wake_up_one_morning_to_find_an_envelope/di4lfyv/) || [**Part 5**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6dk6ex/wp_you_wake_up_one_morning_to_find_an_envelope/di4uemp/) || [**Part 6**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6dk6ex/wp_you_wake_up_one_morning_to_find_an_envelope/di4wjxr/) <eos>

I remember hearing the scream only faintly, before the warm sensation of burning overtook my leg and my muscles suddenly felt the urge to go on holiday. <nl> I opened my eyes slowly, with a sudden realization that I should clean my bathroom floor more often. I pushed myself up slowly, and discovered that my house guest had helped herself to one of my favorite pair of lounging shorts, thought that was as far as she'd managed to dress herself in the moments in which my brain decided to forgo consciousness. <nl> ""I'm sorry I panicked."" She said, in a voice that sounded as groggy as I felt, witha healthy dose of bitter anger thrown in for good measure. ""I don't suppose you remember where we threw my clothes last night, do you?"" <nl> I attempted to think of something witty to retort, but after running my fingers across the taser burn on my thigh, I thought it might be best to skip my usual snark. ""I think I remember seeing your bra in the sink"" I said, suddenly losing the urge to control my demeanor adding ""you can't miss it. It's right next to the check for $50,000,000."" <nl> She walked over to the kitchen, grimacing as she picked up her bra and finding that it was in no state to be worn. Even in my state of delirium, the math was starting to fill itself in as to what happened to my Friday evening and the better part of my Saturday afternoon. I thought, perhaps, my house-guest might be able to confirm some of my suspicions. <nl> ""Um, I know this sounds pretty cliche,"" I started only to be met with a scowl that could have stopped a bull elephant in it's tracks. I decided to forgo better judgement and press on in the name of scientific inquiry. ""I'm afraid I'm a little fuzzy on some of the details that led to... well... that led to where we are right now."" <nl> She slid open the kitchen window and started climbing onto the fire escape, a comical sight though I dare not say anything to invoke further wrath. She climbed back through a moment later with a rather smart dress which had found it's way outside in lord only knows what way. She slid it on over her head, continuing in a single fluid (rather impressive actually) motion to remove my shorts without further compromising her modesty, only to wad them up and throw them at me. <nl> ""You know,"" she started, ""I'll admit I knew that you were full of it, and I was willing to ignore it because I wanted to have some fun. But if you're going to pull a stunt like that again, at least fake it a little better next time"" she said picking up the check and slamming it down. She walked towards my door. She unlocked it, paused for a moment, turned around, angrily grabbed her bra off the counter, looked at the check one more time and angrily snorted ""lottery winner. Good one asshole"" before returning to the war path which led her conveniently through my door. <nl> ""Well... so much for that mystery"" I thought out loud as I chuckled at the very fake looking check. I didn't think I was the type to sink to a gimmick that low just to get a girl home, but the evidence was pretty damning. I guess in my drunken state I reeled her in with stories about winning the lottery, and decided to seal the deal by somehow acquiring a dummy check for $50,000,000 to impress her with back home. I can't believe how foolish, or perhaps brazen I was to write ""mission successful"" to myself in the memo line. That's low even by recently-divorced-in-your-30s standards. I actually felt pretty slimy. <nl> As I walked back over to the bathroom to wash myself clean of such a shameful evening, I was interrupted by a knock at the door. As I walked over to the door, I realized I owed this woman quite an apology. ""Listen,"" I started as I reached for the door, ""I really ought to apologize to you for the..."" <nl> I swung the door open to find that the attractive young woman with tossed bathtub hair I was expecting was in fact two stout men in suits who looked about as pleased to see my birthday suit was I was to show it to them. <nl> ""I see our newest agent is as discreet as we feared"" the first man said to the other. <nl> ""It doesn't matter."" the second man retorted. ""He's off the radar, and he's willing. That's all we need."" <nl> At this point I started looking around for hidden cameras, but before I could even begin to comprehend just what in the hell was happening, the men invited themselves in. <nl> ""Ah"" the first man said. ""I see the first part of our mission was successful and you have the check."" <nl> ""Good. Good."" the second man said, ""though I would have hoped you would cashed the check by now. Really adds a step to our day and we're on a timeline."" <nl> ""Well,"" I started, realizing that I was so lost about this situation that nothing I said next could possibly make sense. ""Well... it's just... you know... it's Saturday, so the banks are closed..."" <nl> I was pretty proud of that! I mean, it should buy me at least a little time, right? <nl> ""Your instructions said nothing about a bank,"" the first man said, ""and it's Sunday."" <nl> ""Now get dressed"" the second man said, ""our plane leaves the country in two hours."" <nl> [**Part 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6dk6ex/wp_you_wake_up_one_morning_to_find_an_envelope/di4bl33/) || [**Part 3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6dk6ex/wp_you_wake_up_one_morning_to_find_an_envelope/di4i5hg/) || [**Part 4**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6dk6ex/wp_you_wake_up_one_morning_to_find_an_envelope/di4lfyv/) || [**Part 5**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6dk6ex/wp_you_wake_up_one_morning_to_find_an_envelope/di4uemp/) || [**Part 6**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6dk6ex/wp_you_wake_up_one_morning_to_find_an_envelope/di4wjxr/) <eos>

"<sos> The first time she met me, I saw her, halfway sprawled across Leonardo's workshop, I thought she might be a harlot that Leonardo had brought in to sketch anatomy. <nl> It was an honest mistake, see, as this wasn't really the first time I'd seen her, but the first time I'd seen her without a disguise.

I asked, cluelessly, and then she hurled me to the ground. An arrow glanced off the side of her armor, and she drew her repeating cross bow off of her hand and kept me pinned in place. <nl> Bizarrely, she didn't mind my pale skin, nor did she mind the fact that my heart beat was dead in my body, just a mobile corpse. Intriguing. <nl> She disappeared when the mongols inevitably seized the city, so I took her for dead, mourned that I never tasted of her veins, and moved on, hitching a ride over to India. <nl> ---- <nl> Or perhaps the first time was older still, when I was but a young scion of a noble house, crestled in the fertile valleys that your kind bares no name for, or recollection of their existence?

"<sos> Jasper rode the elevator alone to Mr. Hu's office on the top floor, while trying his best not to dampen the manila folder too much with his sweaty palms. It was a feeling shared by everyone in the building; today's meeting was a critical turning point not just for the company, but for the country of Edensia. <nl> The secretary gave Jasper a tight smile and waved him through immediately into the CEO's spacious office. It was a grand place; lots of old-world wood mixed with next-generation steel, a marriage fit for one who, in many ways, was industrial royalty. <nl> Mr. Hu himself cut an impressive figure. Wide-shouldered and extremely tall, with hair of pure silver, he was standing at the window, hands knotted behind his back as he watched his empire. Jasper noted the rare appearance of Mr. Hu's tailored suit today. There were all kinds of superstitious rumors about it. <nl> ""Mr. Hu, the delegation is here,"" Jasper said. <nl> The CEO didn't reply, but raised a hand and made a beckoning gesture. Jasper hurried to his side. <nl> ""I don't think you've seen the country from here,"" Mr. Hu said, stroking his bare chin. His glasses glinted with sunlight. <nl> Jasper could only nod. Being almost two thousand feet above the ground, he had a good view of their city of New Congo, as well as the surrounding plains interspersed by forests. The occasional city dotted the horizon, all of it belonging to the youngest country in the world. Edensia was a tiny nation carved out of Central Africa, following a period of strife and all-out war that even the UN had failed to quell. Ultimately, heavily armed corporations and private military groups had swooped in and seized control of the territory, giving rise to a unique new system of government--one that the world had not come to terms with yet. Mr. Hu's Phoenix Energy Corporation had been one of the first, with an aim to rebuild the country's energy sector. <nl> But the seas were rough and the voyage worse. Mr. Hu's face was lined with worry as he studied the fenced compound about a mile away, where construction workers were rushing the completion of a new coal-fired plant. <nl> Jasper didn't want to disturb his boss's thoughts, but cleared his throat nonetheless. ""Sir, the meeting?"" <nl> Mr. Hu blinked and turned from the window, facing him at last. ""Yes. Shall we?"" <nl> As they headed to the elevator, Jasper offered the folder and the notes inside to the CEO, but Mr. Hu waved it away. The CEO rarely relied on printed materials; he preferred working through a meeting on his instincts. It was what made him a skilled negotiator. <nl> Six floors down and a maze of corridors later, they arrived at the boardroom. Armed guards stood at attention outside, flanking some other top executives of the company. Of the visiting delegation, he saw no sign. <nl> ""They're inside,"" one of the guards said, guessing at his searching look. <nl> With Mr. Hu in the lead, their party entered the boardroom and fanned out to greet their visitors. Jasper, however, stood by the door, studying the latter group as everyone shook hands. <nl> The visiting delegation was a group of eight, four men and four women, of various age groups and nationalities. They all wore green shirts, some with camo patterns, and caps printed with a logo of a black rhino over a splash of white. Their leader, a man known as Jodhi, clasped Mr. Hu's hands genially. His grin had the sparkle of gold, matching the earrings and rings adorning his fingers. <nl> Once everyone was seated, Jodhi said, ""Thank you for having us here, Mr. Hu. It is a pleasure to finally meet you in person."" <nl> ""Likewise,"" Mr. Hu said. The older CEO was drumming his fingers on the arms of his chair. Jasper felt a strange urge to yell at him to stop. <nl> ""I regret, however, that it's taken so long for you to agree to meet us."" Jodhi's band nodded solemnly. ""The people of this country have had their voices silenced for so long, and when you, Mr. Hu, and all the other corporations came to restore order, we thought there would be change. A new dawn. A new beginning."" <nl> ""But it seems that our oppressors have only been replaced. It gives me no pleasure to point fingers, but you are one of them."" <nl> The snake, Jodhi thought. He actually looks apologetic. <nl> Mr. Hu merely smiled and motioned for him to carry on. <nl> Jodhi stood and strode toward the window. ""As we speak here, this beautiful country is being raped and plundered. Your company has come to steal our riches, and to control our people, for the sake of your profits. You want to hold us all hostage under your new energy laws. Everyday you destroy more forests, more homes, to make way for your grids. You pollute the air with fumes that our children breathe. You poison our rivers with sludge that our children drink. You--"" <nl> ""I'm sorry for cutting you off, Jodhi, but I've heard this all before,"" Mr. Hu said. ""I believe you made the same speech last week in Paris, last month in Washington and ... where was it before? Ah, Vienna. No, you were there on holiday, I forgot."" <nl> Mr. Hu smirked. ""Yes, I know where you've been. Your environmental group has been paying you rather well, I think. Public donations are surging ... I wonder if your donors know you've recently bought three penthouses in London and Singapore?"" <nl> ""Let's just cut to the chase. My operations have been interrupted far too many times by a washed up actor using social concerns for his own gains. I cannot tolerate that anymore. The entire truth about you will be released next week, broadcast across the world, if you do not disband your little Save Edensia organization by tomorrow. Do you understand?"" <nl> Jodhi clenched his fist and looked at his team, but they only stared mutely at Mr. Hu. Maybe they weren't aware themselves, Jasper thought. <nl> Then Jodhi relaxed visibly, smiling. ""Very clever. You've done your research. Let's deal. You agree right now to stop building Plant Eight, right there outside this window, and I'll resign from my position. Win-win. Save Edensia will have the victory it needs, and you'll get me out of the way."" <nl> Mr. Hu folded his arms. ""Not going to happen."" <nl> Jodhi shrugged and raised his phone. ""Guess I'll just have to make a call then."" <nl> For a second, nobody reacted to that unusual request, but then the puzzle fell into its frame. ""Stop him,"" Jasper shouted. <nl> Too late; Jodhi thumbed the phone, and a distant boom was heard. A column of smoke slowly wound its way up into the air. <nl> ""That's, what, the third plant this month?"" Jodhi said with a grin. ""Lots of accidents these days, you really should look into some form of OSHA. Oh, and the class action lawsuits by these poor, unprotected workers are really adding up, aren't they?"" <nl> Mr. Hu shot Jasper a single look, and Jasper complied. He drew a pistol, hidden in the folder all this while, and put a bullet into Jodhi's skull. The rest of the Save Edensia team jumped to their feet, but none made it to the door. <nl> Mr. Hu cupped his head in his hands and groaned. Jasper felt a pang of sympathy for him; he knew the CEO had genuinely wanted to negotiate. Perhaps Jodhi's replacement would be more reasonable. Personally, Jasper wasn't optimistic. Peace and prosperity in this new nation could only be obtained from the end of a gun. <nl> Lucky for him, his was the hand holding it. <nl> *** <nl> *Thanks for reading.

You want to hold us all hostage under your new energy laws. Everyday you destroy more forests, more homes, to make way for your grids. You pollute the air with fumes that our children breathe. You poison our rivers with sludge that our children drink. You--"" <nl> ""I'm sorry for cutting you off, Jodhi, but I've heard this all before,"" Mr. Hu said. ""I believe you made the same speech last week in Paris, last month in Washington and ... where was it before? Ah, Vienna. No, you were there on holiday, I forgot."" <nl> Mr. Hu smirked. ""Yes, I know where you've been. Your environmental group has been paying you rather well, I think. Public donations are surging ... I wonder if your donors know you've recently bought three penthouses in London and Singapore?"" <nl> ""Let's just cut to the chase. My operations have been interrupted far too many times by a washed up actor using social concerns for his own gains. I cannot tolerate that anymore. The entire truth about you will be released next week, broadcast across the world, if you do not disband your little Save Edensia organization by tomorrow. Do you understand?"" <nl> Jodhi clenched his fist and looked at his team, but they only stared mutely at Mr. Hu. Maybe they weren't aware themselves, Jasper thought. <nl> Then Jodhi relaxed visibly, smiling. ""Very clever. You've done your research. Let's deal. You agree right now to stop building Plant Eight, right there outside this window, and I'll resign from my position. Win-win. Save Edensia will have the victory it needs, and you'll get me out of the way."" <nl> Mr. Hu folded his arms. ""Not going to happen."" <nl> Jodhi shrugged and raised his phone. ""Guess I'll just have to make a call then."" <nl> For a second, nobody reacted to that unusual request, but then the puzzle fell into its frame. ""Stop him,"" Jasper shouted. <nl> Too late; Jodhi thumbed the phone, and a distant boom was heard. A column of smoke slowly wound its way up into the air. <nl> ""That's, what, the third plant this month?"" Jodhi said with a grin. ""Lots of accidents these days, you really should look into some form of OSHA. Oh, and the class action lawsuits by these poor, unprotected workers are really adding up, aren't they?"" <nl> Mr. Hu shot Jasper a single look, and Jasper complied. He drew a pistol, hidden in the folder all this while, and put a bullet into Jodhi's skull. The rest of the Save Edensia team jumped to their feet, but none made it to the door. <nl> Mr. Hu cupped his head in his hands and groaned. Jasper felt a pang of sympathy for him; he knew the CEO had genuinely wanted to negotiate. Perhaps Jodhi's replacement would be more reasonable. Personally, Jasper wasn't optimistic. Peace and prosperity in this new nation could only be obtained from the end of a gun. <nl> Lucky for him, his was the hand holding it. <nl> *** <nl> *Thanks for reading.

"<sos> ""Hey Mary, quit slacking off. Someone's summoning you again."" <nl> I tilted up my sunglasses, stretching out on my lawn-chair, and set down the tomatoey cocktail that I had named after myself. ""Go away,"" I said, yawning. ""Not today."" <nl> ""Yes, today."" Jerry's shadow towered down over me, blotting out all the rays of sun that my pale skin was trying to soak up. ""There's not a choice in this."" <nl> ""For fuck's sake, what's the point?"" I reached over and picked up my beer from the chair's other cup-holder. That was my left-hand drink. ""It's not like these schmucks ever wish for anything. They only summon me to get a picture for their horror-themed instagrams."" <nl> He crossed him arms. ""There's no use in arguing. We both know the rules."" <nl> ""I'm not a performer."" <nl> Jerry sighed. ""I'm going to count to three."" <nl> The sunglasses slid off my forehead to fall back over my eyes. ""Are you now?"" <nl> ""One."" <nl> ""Jerry, I don't care if you count -- "" <nl> ""Two."" <nl> ""Come on, will you just wait for two seconds -- "" <nl> ""*Three!*"" <nl> There was a faint popping in my ears, and then suddenly the beautiful day turned black and beer spilled everywhere in a splash of gold foam. My entire body started to constrict, and I felt pressure as if I was suddenly being forced through a very tiny tube. <nl> I arrived at my new destination with all the grace of crashing into a wall - which is exactly what happened to me. I smashed straight into the mirror, breaking my nose. Blood poured down my face, and I rushed to cover my wound and stop the bleeding, swearing. <nl> No matter how many times I went through it, being summoned would always be a bitch...and would always result in grievous bodily injury. <nl> A scrawny looking teenage girl stared back at me from the other side of the mirror, her face white with fear. She clapped her hands over her mouth, giving me a look of sheer terror that I was all too familiar with. <nl> ""Yes, it's me,"" I said, my words muffled from behind my hands, as blood trickled through my fingers. ""Now, before you go run away screaming, will you at least try to calm down -- "" <nl> Annnnnnddd she was gone. <nl> Sighing, I looked wistfully at the box of tissues staring back at me from the other side of the mirror, as blood continued to spout like a firehouse. <nl> ""What are you looking at, kleenex?"" I said, pinching at the bridge of my nose. ""Haven't you ever seen a genie with a god-damn bloody nose before?"" <nl> I took a sharp breath, preparing for the hellish journey to re-enter the void and return to back home, but just before I turned to leave, I heard the door creak open. <nl> ""You look like you're hurt,"" a voice from behind me said. I spun back around to find the teenage staring back at me. ""Are you okay?"" <nl> ""About as okay as one can be after running into a wall of glass at a hundred miles per hour."" <nl> ""I'm sorry. Didn't mean for that to happen."" <nl> ""It's cool, happens every time. I'm used to it."" I sniffed. The woman staring back at me was still trembling, hovering one foot back into the bathroom, one foot into the hall, too curious to turn away. I got these folks every once in a while. She was just stalling to get a picture of me on her phone before running away again and posting it on social media. ""So are you just going to stand there all day? Or can you snap your selfie and we'll both get on with our lives?"" <nl> ""I didn't mean to hurt you,"" she said, frowning. ""Are you going to kill me now?"" <nl> I pointed a bloody hand at her. ""Yep,"" I said. ""You summoned me, and now I have to kill you."" <nl> She started to tremble again, looking down at the ground. ""It's okay, really. I'm ready. That's why I called you in the first place. "" <nl> The theatrically maniacal smile died on my face. ""Huh?"" <nl> ""Just get on with it. I hate this place. I'm ready."" <nl> This was getting dark real quick, and I found myself starting to sweat. ""Come on, I'm not really going to kill you. I was just fucking with you."" I wiped my nose, smearing blood everywhere. ""I'm actually a genie. I grant wishes and shit. Can you believe that?"" <nl> ""Nope."" <nl> ""I'm not lying. Give me a try. Wish for anything."" <nl> ""Fine. Then I wish that you kill m- "" <nl> ""Woah, woah, woah. Hold on a second."" I  threw up my hands, the palms now scarlet from tending to my injury. ""Let's slow down for a moment. Umm. What's your name?"" <nl> ""Tara,"" she said. She looked down at her feet. <nl> ""Hi Tara, I'm Mary. Now, do you want to see something cool?"" <nl> ""Like what?"" <nl> ""I dunno..."" I stalled, feeling the blood in my nose start to clot. I had never stayed long enough in someone's bathroom for this to happen before. ""What if I made an eldritch horror pop out of your toilet? That'd be fun, right?"" <nl> The girl shrugged. ""I dunno. I guess."" <nl> ""Come on, it's really cool. They aren't even that dangerous. Just scary."" I winked. ""Some of the best things in this world are like that."" <nl> The girl looked up at me, her wide eyes curious again. ""So I'll tell you what, I'll make Chthulu Jr. pop out of the can, and while I do that, I want you to think really hard about three wishes that would really make you happy. Can you do that for me?"" <nl> ""Okay,"" she said. Then for the first time, she covered her mouth with her hand and smiled. Damn, seeing that from the sad girl a moment ago made me feel good. This genie shit might not be so bad after all. <nl> ""Hell yeah."" My eyes started to turn red as I summoned my magic. Suddenly there was bubble and a crash from the toilet, and Tara gave a squeak of delight. <nl> ""Is that..."" <nl> ""Don't get too close,"" I warned, as Tara edged towards the mysterious noises. I smiled, raising a hand to my nose, and found the bleeding had completely stopped now. <nl> Maybe this time, it would stay that way. <nl> * * * <nl> /r/ghost_write_the_whip <eos>

"<sos> Don Luca ran a hand through his hair, clear blue eyes scrutinising the whelp of a boy in front of him. Antonio shrunk under his gaze, as a flower does in such cold environments. <nl> It wasn't lost on him that there couldn't have possibly been two people more different in appearance sitting across from one another; where the Don was broad and imposing, Antonio was diminutive, where Luca had gone to painstaking effort to keep himself as crisp and clean as one could look, Antonio appeared one cut of clothing above homelessness. In honesty, that wasn't far from the truth of matters; Antonio had found no work for five years running at this point. <nl> The Don gave Antonio's resume one last look-over before plucking the cigarette from his lips. Something caught his eye, making him chuckle. On it, he'd requested everything about the boy, not just qualifications of the academic variety; all the personal, the sensitive and the downright unsavory as well. He likely knew the boy more intimately than his own parents did. ""Why do you wish to work for me, *bambino*? What place is there for you amongst criminals? A...."" he looked down at the sheet, ""...student of literature, such as yourself?"" <nl> *'I want out of this fucking debt.'* Antonio pursed his lips, stumbling on his words as they left him. ""I, *umm* - I believe placement amongst your business would p-provide me with valuable work experience and connections. Networking, networking, networking - that's what my mother used to say!"" <nl> Luca raised a brow, reclining into his chair. ""I think you have us mistaken, then. What I run isn't a business; it's a *family*. We do not have manager and worker, we have father and child. And when one becomes acquainted with a family, they do not tend to leave. Do you understand what I'm saying?"" <nl> Antonio's lips quirked up in acknowledgment, his head dipping forward like he was about to indulge a secret. ""Once you're in, you're in."" <nl> ""Simply put."" <nl> *I can live with it, given this economy.* ""What's the pay like?"" <nl> ""Consider it a merit-based system; the more you do, the more I deign to give you."" <nl> ""But, like, how *much*? What does everyone else get?"" <nl> Luca shrugged, flicking through some papers on his desk, his eyes no longer on Antonio. ""I *could* provide a base for comparison, but the wages of those within the family are strictly confidential, you must understand."" <nl> '*Fuck me once, fuck me twice.'* Antonio gripped the edge of his seat. He *needed* this. ""Fine, I get that. No problem, you're all secretive and shit. But what do I actually have to do to be welcomed into the family?"" <nl> Luca's lips broke into a half-moon of a grin, and it was then that Antonio knew he'd asked the wrong question. Luca slid a sheet across the desk, which Antonio picked up to read. <nl> His face flushed of colour. <nl> As he read, his fingers shook, barely able to hold the weight the page now bore. <nl> Luca continued talking, either oblivious or outright ignoring the boy. ""My program to pay off the debts of students has had an interesting effect on my family; now everyone wants in, but there aren't just so many pieces to go around. Wheat must be separated from chaff, boy from man. As such, I've devised an aptitude test, if you wish to call it that. All I need is the person on the sheet knocked unconscious, and a picture taken of their body. It doesn't matter how or where you do it, but there are three things I wish to see from you: decisiveness, discretion and, of course, results."" <nl> The page fluttered out of Antonio's hands, drifting to the floor. The boy gulped a knot of tension down before standing up, reaching over to pick the paper up. <nl> ""H-how long do I get?"" <nl> ""One month."" <nl> ""And if I fail? - as in, to... photograph her."" <nl> ""Let's not dwell on the specifics of failure. Envision only success."" Luca lit another cigarette, his grin benevolent. ""Cigarette?"" <nl> Antonio felt like he'd collapse, his head a churning cauldron of emotion that'd explode at any minute. He waved a hand, unable to articulate a response as he stumbled out of the office, paper in hand. <nl> A few moments later, Luca's Consigliere walked through the door, his face tucked into an overcoat, black shades and a wide-brim hat covering all but a few blonde locks of hair that fell from underneath. He took the cigarette from Luca's mouth, stamping it out. ""Stop with that shit."" <nl> ""That's no way to treat your Don,"" Luca frowned. <nl> ""Go fuck yourself."" <nl> The two stared each other down, the silence boiling in the room before it was broken by a chortle from Luca's lips. The Don laughed, as did the Consiliegere; a raucous, hearty sound that didn't stop for a full minute. <nl> ""Ahhh,"" Luca calmed himself, wiping an errant tear from his eye. ""How did yours go, Eren?"" <nl> ""Chickened out like the last five of 'em."" <nl> ""See to that, will you?"" <nl> ""But of course."" Eren cast a glance over his shoulder. ""What about that one? Want me to keep tabs?"" <nl> Luca waved a hand in dismissal. ""I think he'll be fine."" <nl> Eren took a seat, pushing his glasses down the bridge of his nose and fixing Luca with a stern glare. ""I thought I taught you better than to place trust in someone you've just met."" <nl> ""You taught me to trust those that are capable, and, well, the boy is indeed capable. Or well suited, rather."" <nl> ""That runt? I'd sooner believe you made Donna Vici his target.""

""You ought to think better of me on matters such as these. Why do you think I've been offering to fund students? We've finally found an in.""*<nl>",1,"<sos> Don Luca ran a hand through his hair, clear blue eyes scrutinising the whelp of a boy in front of him. Antonio shrunk under his gaze, as a flower does in such cold environments. <nl>*Luca simply shrugged. ""Surprisingly, I did. Look."" He fumbled through the papers on his desk, producing Antonio's resume and holding it out. ""You ought to think better of me on matters such as these. Why do you think I've been offering to fund students? We've finally found an in.""*<nl><nl> It wasn't lost on him that there couldn't have possibly been two people more different in appearance sitting across from one another; where the Don was broad and imposing, Antonio was diminutive, where Luca had gone to painstaking effort to keep himself as crisp and clean as one could look, Antonio appeared one cut of clothing above homelessness. In honesty, that wasn't far from the truth of matters; Antonio had found no work for five years running at this point. <nl> The Don gave Antonio's resume one last look-over before plucking the cigarette from his lips. Something caught his eye, making him chuckle. On it, he'd requested everything about the boy, not just qualifications of the academic variety; all the personal, the sensitive and the downright unsavory as well. He likely knew the boy more intimately than his own parents did. ""Why do you wish to work for me, *bambino*? What place is there for you amongst criminals? A...."" he looked down at the sheet, ""...student of literature, such as yourself?"" <nl> *'I want out of this fucking debt.'* Antonio pursed his lips, stumbling on his words as they left him. ""I, *umm* - I believe placement amongst your business would p-provide me with valuable work experience and connections. Networking, networking, networking - that's what my mother used to say!"" <nl> Luca raised a brow, reclining into his chair. ""I think you have us mistaken, then. What I run isn't a business; it's a *family*. We do not have manager and worker, we have father and child. And when one becomes acquainted with a family, they do not tend to leave. Do you understand what I'm saying?"" <nl> Antonio's lips quirked up in acknowledgment, his head dipping forward like he was about to indulge a secret. ""Once you're in, you're in."" <nl> ""Simply put."" <nl> *I can live with it, given this economy.* ""What's the pay like?"" <nl> ""Consider it a merit-based system; the more you do, the more I deign to give you."" <nl> ""But, like, how *much*? What does everyone else get?"" <nl> Luca shrugged, flicking through some papers on his desk, his eyes no longer on Antonio. ""I *could* provide a base for comparison, but the wages of those within the family are strictly confidential, you must understand."" <nl> '*Fuck me once, fuck me twice.'* Antonio gripped the edge of his seat. He *needed* this. ""Fine, I get that. No problem, you're all secretive and shit. But what do I actually have to do to be welcomed into the family?"" <nl> Luca's lips broke into a half-moon of a grin, and it was then that Antonio knew he'd asked the wrong question. Luca slid a sheet across the desk, which Antonio picked up to read. <nl> His face flushed of colour. <nl> As he read, his fingers shook, barely able to hold the weight the page now bore. <nl> Luca continued talking, either oblivious or outright ignoring the boy. ""My program to pay off the debts of students has had an interesting effect on my family; now everyone wants in, but there aren't just so many pieces to go around. Wheat must be separated from chaff, boy from man. As such, I've devised an aptitude test, if you wish to call it that. All I need is the person on the sheet knocked unconscious, and a picture taken of their body. It doesn't matter how or where you do it, but there are three things I wish to see from you: decisiveness, discretion and, of course, results."" <nl> The page fluttered out of Antonio's hands, drifting to the floor. The boy gulped a knot of tension down before standing up, reaching over to pick the paper up. <nl> ""H-how long do I get?"" <nl> ""One month."" <nl> ""And if I fail? - as in, to... photograph her."" <nl> ""Let's not dwell on the specifics of failure. Envision only success."" Luca lit another cigarette, his grin benevolent. ""Cigarette?"" <nl> Antonio felt like he'd collapse, his head a churning cauldron of emotion that'd explode at any minute. He waved a hand, unable to articulate a response as he stumbled out of the office, paper in hand. <nl> A few moments later, Luca's Consigliere walked through the door, his face tucked into an overcoat, black shades and a wide-brim hat covering all but a few blonde locks of hair that fell from underneath. He took the cigarette from Luca's mouth, stamping it out. ""Stop with that shit."" <nl> ""That's no way to treat your Don,"" Luca frowned. <nl> ""Go fuck yourself."" <nl> The two stared each other down, the silence boiling in the room before it was broken by a chortle from Luca's lips. The Don laughed, as did the Consiliegere; a raucous, hearty sound that didn't stop for a full minute. <nl> ""Ahhh,"" Luca calmed himself, wiping an errant tear from his eye. ""How did yours go, Eren?"" <nl> ""Chickened out like the last five of 'em."" <nl> ""See to that, will you?"" <nl> ""But of course."" Eren cast a glance over his shoulder. ""What about that one? Want me to keep tabs?"" <nl> Luca waved a hand in dismissal. ""I think he'll be fine."" <nl> Eren took a seat, pushing his glasses down the bridge of his nose and fixing Luca with a stern glare. ""I thought I taught you better than to place trust in someone you've just met."" <nl> ""You taught me to trust those that are capable, and, well, the boy is indeed capable. Or well suited, rather."" <nl> ""That runt? I'd sooner believe you made Donna Vici his target."" The rival Donna had been a thorn in Luca's side for some time, but he'd never dared to pluck it out with his own hands for fear of starting a war. <nl> Luca remained eerily silent, offering a furtive smile to the Consigliere. <nl> ""Oh, you didn't.

I like to bring my own, you know, it's a little habit of mine..."" <nl> The woman - her name was Alice, he knew that much - gave a coy smile and shook her head, her dark curls flying. ""Oh, I don't drink. You never know when someone might want to poison you, you know."" <nl> They stared at each other for a brief moment, and started to laugh. <nl> ""Well, fair enough, I guess,"" Charles said, hiding his frustration behind a grin. <nl> Poison, no, but the little extra something he'd slipped in would have made her pleasantly compliable, and much easier to transport to his secondary location. But never mind, never mind. The night was young and fresh still, with many hours stretching out before him to conclude his business. <nl> ""So, you go on blind dates often?"" Alice stretched out the word 'blind', staring intently into Charles' eyes. <nl> Such lovely, light blue eyes. Her mouth curled into a smile as she imagined how he would look by the end of the night. The rest of him would be quite ruined, of course, but she would make sure to save those pretty eyes for her collection.

""My dates never call me back, for some reason."" <nl> ""Poor baby."" She leaned forward to touch his wrist, hoping the powder she'd transfer there would be enough to knock him out. <nl> It was almost too easy by now - she'd simply have to act panicked when her date fainted, and get him out of here. Someone would probably even help load him into a cab for her. He jerked his hands back before she could do it, however, and she stared at him. No-one had *ever* rejected her. He looked discomfited. <nl> ""Sorry, I...don't like being touched unexpectedly,"" he said, flustered, kicking himself for the awkward explanation. <nl> It was perfectly true, but he'd always been able to act normal on these occasions before.

And it wasn't sex. <nl> ""That's quite alright, I guess I'm just too comfortable with you,"" she said graciously, curling her hands into fists on her lap, carefully wiping her fingertips clean on the tablecloth. <nl> Perhaps she'd moved too fast. There was something about this one that made her eager to get him back to her place, to play....for the first time in a long time, she felt anticipation for the act that would precede her kill.

Charles changed the subject abruptly, gesturing towards the cover of the newspaper the man at the table across from them was reading. <nl> He couldn't resist - the cover was splashed with the details of his last *date*, after all. It always gave him a delicious thrill to discuss his actions, to pretend to be as horrified as the rest of them. <nl> ""Oh, yes,"" said Alice, sparing the newspaper a single glance, her lip curling slightly. ""Shocking, I guess. A little...unimaginative, though."" <nl> She said the last sentence under her breath, almost unconsciously. But Charles heard her, and  his pulse quickened. That wasn't a normal response. That wasn't normal at all. <nl> ""Oh?

"<sos> It was the silence that made me realize something was wrong.  One month into the siege of the human city on the planet they called Sacrifice, and not a peep from them since the initial attack.  Not a single cry of help from the hopelessly outgunned settlement, set for ""forceful relocation"" once our ground troops got here. <nl> ... <nl> It was nothing personal, really.  An international snafu among the council species was threatening to expand into full blown war, and this planet was a prime spot to set up a forward base, should any sort of aggressive action be necessary.  And it might not, we had a small cultural attachment who first attempted to convince the humans to leave.  Jolkn, our millitary anthropologist, immediately took to the humans, spending extra shore leave during the diplomatic phase of our takeover in their village.  He was fond of some sort of mind affecting drug the humans favored called ""Absinthe"". <nl> It was with the scent of Absinthe on the air that he outlined what he learned in a week or two of interaction with the locals. <nl> ""They're quite friendly, honestly.  A social species, small local government involving representation.  Imagine a Sigmar with a sense of humor.""  His face radiated warmth as he recounted.  ""Most races I've studied are welcoming on first contact, but even after I told them we were here to oust them from their settlement, they changed the subject and continued to graciously host me.  That made learning about them all the easier.  They boasted about their past, how they got here through centuries of conflict and hardship.  And their history does seem especially bloody."" <nl> ""Did you know?"" He asked me excitedly, ""the first humans hunted not with venom or great strength, but by sheer efficiency.  They tracked their prey for upwards of an entire solar cycle, never letting it sleep or rest.  Once its reserves of energy ran dry, the actual kill was simple.  This allowed them to take down creatures that would normally wipe them out in a fair fight."" <nl> I mulled this over for a bit. ""I assume then that they're fond of and practiced in siege warfare?

","Unfortunately no, commander.  You are to withdraw all forces and depart for headquarters.  You and your crew are being court martialed."" <nl>",4,"<sos> It was the silence that made me realize something was wrong.  One month into the siege of the human city on the planet they called Sacrifice, and not a peep from them since the initial attack.  Not a single cry of help from the hopelessly outgunned settlement, set for ""forceful relocation"" once our ground troops got here. <nl> ... <nl> It was nothing personal, really.  An international snafu among the council species was threatening to expand into full blown war, and this planet was a prime spot to set up a forward base, should any sort of aggressive action be necessary.  And it might not, we had a small cultural attachment who first attempted to convince the humans to leave.  Jolkn, our millitary anthropologist, immediately took to the humans, spending extra shore leave during the diplomatic phase of our takeover in their village.  He was fond of some sort of mind affecting drug the humans favored called ""Absinthe"". <nl> It was with the scent of Absinthe on the air that he outlined what he learned in a week or two of interaction with the locals. <nl>Unfortunately no, commander.  You are to withdraw all forces and depart for headquarters.  You and your crew are being court martialed."" <nl><nl> ""They're quite friendly, honestly.  A social species, small local government involving representation.  Imagine a Sigmar with a sense of humor.""  His face radiated warmth as he recounted.  ""Most races I've studied are welcoming on first contact, but even after I told them we were here to oust them from their settlement, they changed the subject and continued to graciously host me.  That made learning about them all the easier.  They boasted about their past, how they got here through centuries of conflict and hardship.  And their history does seem especially bloody."" <nl> ""Did you know?"" He asked me excitedly, ""the first humans hunted not with venom or great strength, but by sheer efficiency.  They tracked their prey for upwards of an entire solar cycle, never letting it sleep or rest.  Once its reserves of energy ran dry, the actual kill was simple.  This allowed them to take down creatures that would normally wipe them out in a fair fight."" <nl> I mulled this over for a bit. ""I assume then that they're fond of and practiced in siege warfare?  That makes things more difficult, we're going to have to cut off their supply lines completely if they refuse to leave."" <nl> ""Yes, that is going to be a concern...

"<sos> He was cute. Too cute, in retrospect; I should have seen the signs. But I am human, mostly, and my brain likes to ignore the Should-Be-Obvious in favor of the Maybe-We-Could. Especially when it's been a while. Which it had. <nl> So I showed up in my favorite get-lucky outfit after spending twice my usual going-out time in front of the mirror, and I flirted and I laughed at his jokes, which were actually pretty good. Very confident and rehearsed, actually, another sign I blundered on past, hoping. When someone's really into you and it's the first date, they tend to be nervous and their jokes tend to be goofy or at least unpolished, and you laugh because, well, you're into *them*, not really the jokes.  This guy? He was putting on a big show of being real into me. Meaning he wasn't really. <nl> But at the time, I was riding high on hope and his really gorgeous eyes and the way his smile drew perfect folds and lines in the rest of his sculpted face, even though the smile and the eyes never really met, you know? Signs. <nl> I didn't let him kiss me, or rather I sent signs of my own that said, ""maybe, probably even, but not just now."" And he picked up on them, because he picked up on everything. <nl> Almost everything, anyway, he didn't pick up on the holdout pistol I had strapped just under my bra, hidden by the billowy part of my favorite top. (It's my favorite for multiple reasons.) So when I first stepped into his no doubt well-insulated apartment and saw his choice of wallpaper, felt the humming hemming-in effect of my own face staring at me from every direction, I went for the weapon. Fortunately the attractive overconfident bastard had his back to me as he strode over to retrieve something from an entry table drawer. <nl> ""Done your research,"" I told him as he turned around with that stupid handsome confident grin and also a very large knife. ""You're gonna want to drop that."" <nl> His eyes locked onto the gun and the grin froze, then slowly drooped at the edges. ""No, you drop yours. You have no power here. I confront you with the sight of your own--"" <nl> I shot him in the gut. He let out an honestly kind of comical gasp of total surprise. Comical first of all because he was obviously an asshole, and bad things happening to bad people is almost always funnier. Second because come on, I was pointing a gun at you, it's not like this should be all that unexpected. I guess he thought the pictures would stop me from doing *anything* rather than just suppress my powers. <nl> ""Drop the knife,"" I said again, keeping my voice almost casual. You don't have to try for menace when you're holding a gun you've already shot them with once. <nl> He did, and dropped himself to his knees. <nl> ""That's better,"" I said. ""I didn't want to have to kill you and have a corpse on my hand. I'm not very hungry after that big dinner."" <nl> The look of horror on his face made me cackle, and then I saw how it was mixed with his clearly excruciating pain and felt a little bad. He was an asshole and Mom wasn't a very nice fey Dad sometimes said I took after her when he was really annoyed and struggling with being a single parent but I'm not heartless, you know? <nl> ""We're not cannibalistic,"" I told him. ""I think Mom lived on mostly mushrooms, and anyway I'm only half. But, given your charming decor here, I'm guessing you already knew most of that."" <nl> ""You shot me,"" he said through gritted teeth. ""I thought you were supposed to be..."" he trailed off as blood made his words increasingly frothy. <nl> ""I did,"" I said, kind of gently because even though he had it coming, this level of pain was hard to watch. ""And yeah, my powers are being suppressed, but, uh, even if I were a full-blood fey it wouldn't actually *neutralize*me. Don't need powers to pull a gun."" <nl> He gurgled for a bit, then coughed. ""Yeah, I...noticed."" His eyes kept tending toward the door behind me. <nl> ""Gods *damn* it,"" I said, and shot him between the eyes, then whirled to cover the door. Three rounds left in my little pistol. I walked slowly forward. No movement, no rattling doorknob. I reached it, tried it. Locked. Of course. Couldn't have me making a run for it. Deadbolt must have gone in automatically; it had a keyhole instead of a knob. <nl> *Shit.* <nl> I backed up slowly, grimaced at the faces, at *my* face, everywhere I looked. Even papered all over the damn door I was trying to get through. The effect of them sat between me and my powers like a wide fuzzy wall, made everything uneasy and slightly grey, drained of the extra-vibrant colors included in my usual perception. <nl> I reached the corpse after what felt like a thousand years of awkward backward crab-walk, fumbled through the pockets of what I tried very hard not to think of as a corpse. <nl> There.

I asked. <nl> Both of them looked around on with a grin on their faces, ""well, you don't think people actually want this furniture do you?"" <eos>

"<sos> June 14, 2038: Every space sensor we had up there was tripped. Satellite images revealed no fewer than fifteen unidentified spacecraft, each the size of several football fields in all dimensions, hovering in our orbit without the slightest indication of how they had arrived there. I was in the Pentagon as I saw the DEFCON counter tick from five to one. You could've cut the tension in the War Room with a butter knife that day. We were in unprecedented territory, the fantasies of an extraterrestrial invasion now a grim reality. Our entire stockpile of surface-to-space missiles was prepped and aimed at these spacecraft, but no shots were fired as of yet. So long as these potential invaders simply hovered above Earth without pursuing direct violence, the Commander-in-Chief wanted to leave a potential avenue for discourse open. For the sake of our survival, I pray his faith in the generosity of these extraterrestrial beings is well-founded. - Gen. B. Stamford <nl> June 15, 2038: As I feared, our Commander-in-Chief was wrong. Five cities were obliterated from the Earth's surface: Tokyo, Mumbai, Mexico City, Lagos, New York. 135 million people vaporized by ungodly beams of plasma from above. Our media suppression fell through, as news networks here and across the globe replayed clip after clip of these cities being glassed to hell. We fired everything we had at them. Hundreds of thousands of surface-to-space missiles from our stockpile alone, complimented by thousands more from our allies and enemies alike. We saw all those little streaks of light making their way towards a few of the enemy spacecraft, praying we could give the bastards a taste of their own medicine. We saw all the miniscule explosions. And...nothing. We couldn't even take out a single one of them. Some sort of energy shielding around their hulls according to the lab geeks. Christ, the faces in the War Room after seeing all that. We gave it everything we possibly could, and it didn't even make a dent. The ball's in the aliens' court now. All we can do now is wait and react. - Gen. B. Stamford <nl> June 16, 2038: Their shock troops touched down on Earth. Five more cities were unfortunate enough to be the landing zones: Shanghai, Cairo, Osaka, Karachi, Los Angeles. We were able to set up the 4th Infantry Division around LA in anticipation of an alien invasion there, but it was a fucking joke. Their equipment was straight out of sci-fi, from plasma-spitting rifles to plated armor that a .50 cal couldn't even punch through. Our guys outnumbered them five to one, and they still got their asses kicked out of the city within an hour. Air Force didn't fare any better, either. Sixteen F-35As wiped out by one of their fighter aircraft. News feeds were chock full with footage of civilians being indiscriminately slaughtered by the alien menace. May God grant us the strength to fight in these dark days ahead. - Gen. B. Stamford <nl> June 17, 2038: More of their infantry landed after their shock troops had cleared LZs for them. The speed with which these aliens can mount an offense is mind-boggling. Makes our finest men look like a bunch of backwater peasants defending their village in the 12th century. We've already lost California. Things don't look much better overseas. And as I sit here penning what may be some of my final words, I can't help but wonder whether there was really anything we could've done to stop this alien menace. - Gen. B. Stamford <nl> June 18, 2038: Jesus, Mary and Joseph. They halted their advance. A baffling tactical error on their part, one which we took full advantage of. Their blunder bought us time to start organizing troops into an ironclad defensive perimeter around California. Further recon showed they're simply holding the line and making sure none of us make any advances towards them. Fine by us. The lab geeks are poring over one of the alien infantry weapons we managed to recover in the retreat. With any luck, we can start to figure out a way to beat these bug-eyed bastards back to wherever the hell they came from. - Gen. B. Stamford <nl> June 19, 2038: More silence from the Xenomorphs, as we've come to designate them. What the hell is their endgame? - Gen. B. Stamford <nl> June 20, 2038: A Xenomorph representative approached our frontline, saying something about wanting to speak with our leader. Seeing as how we needed to buy as much time as we could, we patched it through with the Commander-in-Chief. The developments from said conversation were...astounding, to say the least. It communicated to us in perfect English that the fifteen dreadnoughts hovering above Earth were merely the *expeditionary* detachment sent to probe our defenses. That their main fighting force which was several thousands of times larger was awaiting the results of their reconnaissance. And, most importantly, that the X'andrei, which was what they called themselves, that were already at Earth wished to help us. Their kind had stumbled upon pro-labor literature from the likes of Gompers and Chavez during their initial invasion of LA, realizing they possessed none of the rights under their X'andrei overlords that our own workers enjoyed. As such, it offered to supply us with the tools to defend ourselves: technology, information, espionage. Maybe this is all just a cruel ruse. Maybe this is some twisted ploy on their part to give us a glimmer of hope before crushing us under their heel. But I've seen what the X'andrei are capable of with my own eyes. And at this point, working with these things may be our last shot at ensuring humanity's survival. - Gen. B. Stamford <nl> r/williamk9949 <eos>

Immortal adjacent, this tall, dark and devilish bachelor is always looking for a way to spread his influence throughout eastern Europe and beyond!* <nl> *Third, the shark that's always clowning around, Pennywise! Actually an inter dimensional force of pure evil, he has a sweet tooth for anything that can make your skin crawl. Better tread careful, he's the one who can make your idea sink or float!* <nl> *Fourth on the docket, just in from a red eye, lord of Mordor but not the ring, Sauron! A fallen spirit succumb to darkness, his path to world domination involves a piece of costume jewelry wielded by two halflings. Best try to not hide anything, nothing escapes his gaze!* <nl> *Lastly, our fifth and final judge: Hitler! It's just Hitler. If you don't know who he is read a book.* <nl> *Today we have the evil monster maker Dr. Abomino, a mad scientist pitching a secret gas that turns any who inhale it into a mutant.* <nl> ""Hello sharks, my name is, eh, Dr. Abomino and I've brought with me today-"" <nl> ""Doctor in what?"" Asked Dr. Frankenstein through thick laboratory goggles. <nl> ""Excuse me?"" Said Dr. Abomino, visibly shaken. <nl> ""What. Is. Your. Doctorate. In."" Repeated Dr. Frankenstein. ""Medicine, biochemistry, neurology, what are we dealing with here?"" <nl> ""Well I am a few credits shy from completing my degree......"" <nl> ""Degree in what *MR.* Abomino?"" <nl> ""Erm.....communication....."" <nl> Frankenstein leaned back in his chair and let out a huff. ""Well Mr. Abomino, you have misrepresented yourself in the first few seconds of your presentation. But please, continue."" Said Frankenstein with a snort as he crossed his arms. <nl> ""Ahem, yes, sorry Doctor. As I was saying I have developed a neurological gas,"" here Hitler began to sit up straight in his seat, ""that does not kill the victim."" Hitler collapsed back in his chair disappointed. <nl> ""Instead, the gas mutates the victim horribly until it becomes a semi human monstrosity, capable of destruction and devastation to all it comes into contact with."" <nl> ""Did you bring an example with you?"" Asked Dracula, tapping his finger tips together. <nl> ""Yes sir, FETCH ME THE BEAST!"" Dr. Abomino commanded to the stage hand holding a doughnut. <nl> A large steel cage covered in a cloth was rolled in. Underneath the cloth came terrible gutteral noises and the sound of metal straining. In one foul swoop, the cloth was ripped off to display the horribly disfigured beast, covered in boils and riddled with deformities. It let out a mighty bellow and rattled the cages walls, desperately striving to be free. <nl> ""Mmmmmhmm, and what are the combat implications Herr Abomino?"" Asked Hitler. <nl> ""They each have the strength of ten men, the endurance of an elephant and a pathological need to enact violence upon mankind."" Replied Abomino proudly. <nl> ""I think I have found a problem with your creation Abomino."" said Hitler. He took out a walther ppk and shot the beast in his head. With one long moan, the abomination collapsed to the floor and let out a death shudder. <nl> ""The problem is,"" said Hitler, ""they can still be killed with weapons as simply as anyone else! And I would bet they cant use guns either!"" <nl> ""Yes that is.....correct....."" Said Abomino, slumping his shoulders and lowering his head. ""But they can be improved! Given armor, dilute the formula to keep the higher reasoning. All I need is some support. I'm asking for one hundred thousand for a 10% stake in the plot."" <nl> ""Im out"" hissed Pennywise. ""No fear factor. No style. Too boring for me to play with. <nl> ""As the only real Doctor here, I can say that this plan is doomed to fail. Therefore, I am also out."" Said Frankenstein. <nl> Sauron gave one thumb down from his seat. <nl> ""It is an interesting idea......fresh take on an old trope..."" Said Dracula licking his fangs. ""But what is your method of control? Telepathic, shock collar, basic training, what do you use?"" Inquired the count. <nl> ""That process is still in the, uh, research and development stage. I am thinking of using a modified shock collar/ body cam combo to remotely check and direct their actions. <nl> ""Wait, you have no ability to control them?"" <nl> ""No sir, that was one of the uses for the funding I requested."" <nl> ""I'm out. I like you Abomino, but you can't just come in here with an idea and nowhere to go with it. You need to have a detailed strategy and a finished product. I'll put you on my backburner and check in with you in a few years, but I'm just not prepared to put the money down on a work in progress."" <nl> *With four sharks out, Hitler is Abomino's last hope. Let's see if they can make a deal...* <nl> ""So, mein friend, it's just the two of us. Would you like to adjust your asking price?"" <nl> ""I, uhh, I think that the hundred thousand for a ten percent stake is very, uh, fair."" <nl> ""Before I make an offer, tell me, how well do they hold up in the cold? Say.....Russia in winter cold....."" <nl> ""My creations have to be kept at, uhm, around forty to eighty degrees for best performance."" <nl> ""Best performance?"" <nl> ""Yes furher, they tend to uhm, expire when taken out of that temperature range for a long period of time."" <nl> ""So, the only thing your creations will be good for invading is a tropical climate? I'm sorry, but the list of soldiers requesting to be stationed in Sicily is already too high, I'm out."" <nl> *The last shark is out, and now Dr. Abomino has no one to make an offer. As such, he must be removed from the tank* <nl> A large trapdoor opened underneath Dr. Abomino and both creator and creation tumbled into a small pool filled with ravenous sharks that had been circling hungrily for hours. The five sharks watched with amusement as the contestant was ripped to shreds by the literal sharks. Frankenstein grinned, Dracula licked his lips and narrowed his eyes, Pennywise giggled gleefully, Sauron looked on motionless, and Hitler kept looking in a mirror. <nl> Craig the production manage came out with his megaphone, ""Alright that's lunch. Be back in 45 everyone, we have a busy day ahead."" <nl> Edit: wow, thanks for all the support and kind words everyone, this was a very pleasant suprise this morning <nl> Edit 2: Ok, this is actually pretty uplifting for me. Thank you again for all the kind words as well as the criticisms. I apologize but I will NOT be doing another of these or expanding upon the prompt. It was an incredibly fun prompt to write and I'm glad you all enjoyed it, but I feel that I've done all I can with it. Personally I just believe that making a sequel with high expectations will never live up to the original. That being said, if anyone wants to use this as a jumping off point or want to expand upon it themselves, you have my blessing. I just ask you credit me or link to this story if you do. Again, one thousands thanks to all of you <eos>

""Medicine, biochemistry, neurology, what are we dealing with here?"" <nl> ""Well I am a few credits shy from completing my degree......"" <nl> ""Degree in what *MR.* Abomino?"" <nl> ""Erm.....communication....."" <nl> Frankenstein leaned back in his chair and let out a huff. ""Well Mr. Abomino, you have misrepresented yourself in the first few seconds of your presentation. But please, continue."" Said Frankenstein with a snort as he crossed his arms. <nl> ""Ahem, yes, sorry Doctor. As I was saying I have developed a neurological gas,"" here Hitler began to sit up straight in his seat, ""that does not kill the victim."" Hitler collapsed back in his chair disappointed. <nl>He took out a walther ppk and shot the beast in his head. With one long moan, the abomination collapsed to the floor and let out a death shudder.<nl><nl> ""Instead, the gas mutates the victim horribly until it becomes a semi human monstrosity, capable of destruction and devastation to all it comes into contact with."" <nl> ""Did you bring an example with you?"" Asked Dracula, tapping his finger tips together. <nl> ""Yes sir, FETCH ME THE BEAST!"" Dr. Abomino commanded to the stage hand holding a doughnut. <nl> A large steel cage covered in a cloth was rolled in. Underneath the cloth came terrible gutteral noises and the sound of metal straining. In one foul swoop, the cloth was ripped off to display the horribly disfigured beast, covered in boils and riddled with deformities. It let out a mighty bellow and rattled the cages walls, desperately striving to be free. <nl> ""Mmmmmhmm, and what are the combat implications Herr Abomino?"" Asked Hitler. <nl> ""They each have the strength of ten men, the endurance of an elephant and a pathological need to enact violence upon mankind."" Replied Abomino proudly. <nl> ""I think I have found a problem with your creation Abomino."" said Hitler. He took out a walther ppk and shot the beast in his head. With one long moan, the abomination collapsed to the floor and let out a death shudder. <nl> ""The problem is,"" said Hitler, ""they can still be killed with weapons as simply as anyone else! And I would bet they cant use guns either!"" <nl> ""Yes that is.....correct....."" Said Abomino, slumping his shoulders and lowering his head. ""But they can be improved! Given armor, dilute the formula to keep the higher reasoning. All I need is some support. I'm asking for one hundred thousand for a 10% stake in the plot."" <nl> ""Im out"" hissed Pennywise. ""No fear factor. No style. Too boring for me to play with. <nl> ""As the only real Doctor here, I can say that this plan is doomed to fail. Therefore, I am also out."" Said Frankenstein. <nl> Sauron gave one thumb down from his seat. <nl> ""It is an interesting idea......fresh take on an old trope..."" Said Dracula licking his fangs. ""But what is your method of control? Telepathic, shock collar, basic training, what do you use?"" Inquired the count. <nl> ""That process is still in the, uh, research and development stage. I am thinking of using a modified shock collar/ body cam combo to remotely check and direct their actions. <nl> ""Wait, you have no ability to control them?"" <nl> ""No sir, that was one of the uses for the funding I requested."" <nl> ""I'm out. I like you Abomino, but you can't just come in here with an idea and nowhere to go with it. You need to have a detailed strategy and a finished product. I'll put you on my backburner and check in with you in a few years, but I'm just not prepared to put the money down on a work in progress."" <nl> *With four sharks out, Hitler is Abomino's last hope. Let's see if they can make a deal...* <nl> ""So, mein friend, it's just the two of us. Would you like to adjust your asking price?"" <nl> ""I, uhh, I think that the hundred thousand for a ten percent stake is very, uh, fair."" <nl> ""Before I make an offer, tell me, how well do they hold up in the cold? Say.....Russia in winter cold....."" <nl> ""My creations have to be kept at, uhm, around forty to eighty degrees for best performance."" <nl> ""Best performance?"" <nl> ""Yes furher, they tend to uhm, expire when taken out of that temperature range for a long period of time."" <nl> ""So, the only thing your creations will be good for invading is a tropical climate? I'm sorry, but the list of soldiers requesting to be stationed in Sicily is already too high, I'm out."" <nl> *The last shark is out, and now Dr. Abomino has no one to make an offer. As such, he must be removed from the tank* <nl> A large trapdoor opened underneath Dr. Abomino and both creator and creation tumbled into a small pool filled with ravenous sharks that had been circling hungrily for hours. The five sharks watched with amusement as the contestant was ripped to shreds by the literal sharks. Frankenstein grinned, Dracula licked his lips and narrowed his eyes, Pennywise giggled gleefully, Sauron looked on motionless, and Hitler kept looking in a mirror. <nl> Craig the production manage came out with his megaphone, ""Alright that's lunch. Be back in 45 everyone, we have a busy day ahead."" <nl> Edit: wow, thanks for all the support and kind words everyone, this was a very pleasant suprise this morning <nl> Edit 2: Ok, this is actually pretty uplifting for me. Thank you again for all the kind words as well as the criticisms. I apologize but I will NOT be doing another of these or expanding upon the prompt. It was an incredibly fun prompt to write and I'm glad you all enjoyed it, but I feel that I've done all I can with it. Personally I just believe that making a sequel with high expectations will never live up to the original. That being said, if anyone wants to use this as a jumping off point or want to expand upon it themselves, you have my blessing. I just ask you credit me or link to this story if you do. Again, one thousands thanks to all of you <eos>

"<sos> It's still dark when I wake up on the morning of April 1st and in my drowsy sleepiness I check my phone to see what time it is. The time passes 5:56 as I watch the clock. <nl> *Jesus Christ, this is just too early on a Saturday* I think to myself and stretch my body as I try to wake up. Normally, I can hear sirens, cars and people outside, even on this time of day but today it's all quiet. There are no noises apart from the wind in the trees and birds chirping. At first, I don't take particular notice of the silence, but as the day goes on, I sure as hell will. <nl> After getting up and taking a shower, I sit at my dining table drinking coffee and eating porridge, watching the street outside. I still haven't seen a single person outside yet, but it's not even 7 o'clock yet. *Everyone's been partying hard today, huh* a thought pops up in my head and I smile. *I'm so funny.* <nl> After breakfast I decide to take a walk. The weather is beautiful. The thin, crisp air surrounds me as I stroll down the quiet streets of Woodstock. There is not a single person out here. I look around, confused, to see if anyone is there. I keep walking, seeing nothing but squirrels and birds in the trees, hearing no cars, no bikes, no nothing. My first thought was, *is something happening at the Inn or what?* but walking towards a closed and empty Woodstock Inn, I realise that's not a possibility. <nl> I call my mom. She lives up in the woods, not far from town. No one picks up. <nl> I then call my grandma, she lives in Hanover in a small apartment close to Dartmouth. No answer there either. I slowly start to get weirded out and consider the possibilities. Instead of standing in the middle of a desolated town square, I go home and start browsing Facebook, Twitter, CBS News, The Guardian, everything I can think of. The last post from every single media was yesterday. All my Facebook friends were online 15 hours ago, President Trump's last obnoxious tweet was at 8pm last night which is **not** like him. I start calling my friends one by one to reach one answering machine after the other. <nl> *No need to panic. There's nothing wrong, just drive to Hanover and find someone who can explain what's happening.* <nl> On my half hour drive to Hanover, crossing the state line, I don't see a single car. Not one. Also, the radio channels just play music, all the channels where hosts usually talk about boring bullshit right about now are playing the same, boring music. <nl> I jokingly make a remark to myself, that I'm the only person on Earth right now. Funny yet scary as I haven't met a single person for hours. It's been 6 hours since I woke up. Not one I have seen for six hours straight. <nl> As I reach Dartmouth College and therefore the middle of the town, I see no one still. Panic starts to roll over me as wave of shivering coldness and I unwillingly start to weep. Warm tears run down my cheeks as I sit in my truck. In sheer panic, I drive around the town for an hour. I go to Walmart which is open but there are no cashiers, no other customers but me. Again, I call my mother whose answering machine yet again reaches me. <nl> I drive home in anger and despair. There is no one left. I think of a zombie apocalypse like in that series but am now 100 % certain that I am going crazy. <nl> I'm going crazy. I'm going crazy. I'm going crazy. <nl> *Dear whoever reads this, <nl> My name is Sara Frazier, I'm a freelance journalist and have woken up to nothing. No people, no sign of life anywhere. I'm scared, I'm terrified and I'm most certainly going crazy. This is just like in my dreams. I've only mentioned them to one person on this Earth and I can't reach him either. Maybe some ancient prophecy is fulfilled and I'm now deemed to be alone forever. <nl> I can't live like this and choose to say goodbye. This is my apocalypse.* <nl> I put on *What a Wonderful World* and listen to the beautiful voice of Louis Armstrong while I load my .45. It was such a wonderful world, that's true. <nl> (Edit: This is my first attempt to write something from a writing prompt and I'm the type of person who's scared shitless of people's opinion.

"<sos> When I turned 15, I was sent to the Sun Edge. I had grown up on the streets of Harka, learning no skill or trade. We couldn't afford the apprenticeship fees. My father had no lands to pass on to me, and all other good farms between there and the Star Edge had been claimed. So on Appraisal Day, there was nowhere else for me to go. <nl> I was given a plot of land to work, only about two meters wide at the beginning. ""It'll grow as the Edge advances,"" they said. The soldiers dropped me at the property line with a gaunt horse and some meager tools. They told me that I could have as much land as I could plow in the North-South direction by the time they returned to the Edge with another resettled orphan. At which point *he* would start plowing where I'd reached, and the cycle would begin all over again. <nl> I'm a city boy. I grew up amongst the trader's tents and the craftsmen's workshops. They'd hired me for every type of menial seasonal job: splitting wood, working bellows, carving out rotted parts of vegetables to make them look fresh... I even helped with the Migration once when the Star Edge got too close to the settlement. We'd loaded up carts with all of the shops and dragged them across the plains until we could see the Sun Edge, and then plopped it all down and set it up again. All of these jobs for a few coins, and the only one I'd never actually done was plow anything. Needless to say, I wasn't making very good headway. <nl> The metal plow fought me every step of the way, snagging on stubborn roots and buried rocks. And when I *could* find some clear ground, then the damned horse would decide that it didn't want to move! <nl> **CLUNK**. The plow ran into something again. But it wasn't the normal dull thud that the rocks made. It was a sharp clang, like the sound of a blacksmith's hammering on stout armor. Maybe another tool? Had some other poor settler been here before me and died with his plow in hand?

As opposed to the cycle continuing as I'd been warned, the Edge and the city were soon just short of blank spots in his memory, fading until they too vanished.<nl>",4,"<sos> When I turned 15, I was sent to the Sun Edge. I had grown up on the streets of Harka, learning no skill or trade. We couldn't afford the apprenticeship fees. My father had no lands to pass on to me, and all other good farms between there and the Star Edge had been claimed. So on Appraisal Day, there was nowhere else for me to go. <nl> I was given a plot of land to work, only about two meters wide at the beginning. ""It'll grow as the Edge advances,"" they said. The soldiers dropped me at the property line with a gaunt horse and some meager tools. They told me that I could have as much land as I could plow in the North-South direction by the time they returned to the Edge with another resettled orphan. At which point *he* would start plowing where I'd reached, and the cycle would begin all over again. <nl> I'm a city boy. I grew up amongst the trader's tents and the craftsmen's workshops. They'd hired me for every type of menial seasonal job: splitting wood, working bellows, carving out rotted parts of vegetables to make them look fresh... I even helped with the Migration once when the Star Edge got too close to the settlement. We'd loaded up carts with all of the shops and dragged them across the plains until we could see the Sun Edge, and then plopped it all down and set it up again. All of these jobs for a few coins, and the only one I'd never actually done was plow anything. Needless to say, I wasn't making very good headway. <nl> The metal plow fought me every step of the way, snagging on stubborn roots and buried rocks. And when I *could* find some clear ground, then the damned horse would decide that it didn't want to move! <nl>He watched it disappear easily again, until nothing remained but the flat horizon. As opposed to the cycle continuing as I'd been warned, the Edge and the city were soon just short of blank spots in his memory, fading until they too vanished.<nl><nl> **CLUNK**. The plow ran into something again. But it wasn't the normal dull thud that the rocks made. It was a sharp clang, like the sound of a blacksmith's hammering on stout armor. Maybe another tool? Had some other poor settler been here before me and died with his plow in hand? I had been in the marketplace long enough to know that even salvaged instruments could fetch a hefty price, maybe even more than whatever pitiful crop I could scrape from the land.

"<sos> She never stopped looking like an angel. <nl> I gently caressed her cheek and placed a kiss on her forehead. Then, I drew a small circle in the sand and lay down next to her. It was my way of tracking time, a circle for each day that passed. Or at least: for each day I *thought* had passed--it's a bit hard to tell honestly, when you're stuck in a moment. <nl> I still remember the day it happened vividly. It was two days before Julia's birthday, but she preferred to celebrate on a saturday instead of a monday. We had dinner at that new place on the boulevard, followed by a long walk on the beach. It was absolutely phenomenal. The sweet summer air, the rhythmic sound of the waves, the stars above us shining bright beyond belief. I thought about proposing to her right then and there, but eventually decided not to because I really wanted her to have my grandmother's ring. Besides, the night was already perfect enough without it. I'd do it some other day. We had all the time in the world. <nl> We fell asleep in each other's arms, the foam of the waves like velvet against our bare legs. Not long after I woke up in a cold sweat. Anxious, nauseous, my mind so overloaded with impulses and thoughts that it physically hurt. At first I was confused--where was I? Was I dreaming? Why was I anxious, did I have a nightmare? I tried to get up but something heavy was in my way. Julia. Her body was rigid, too rigid. I immediately reached for her pulse, fearing the worst, but then my mind unclouded and realization set in: it was happening again. A look at the ocean confirmed my suspicions. A field of blue hills, unmoving. A seagull, stuck in mid-dive. A campfire a little further along the beach, not a flicker seen nor a crackle heard. Time had stopped, because something was going to kill me. <nl> I took a couple of deep breaths to calm myself, and set about doing what I always did: a good old *Hammer Time* session. I had developed a routine, sort of, over the years. Deep breaths first, then I'd half-sing, half-hum *U Can't Touch This*--it's silly and a bit tacky, I know, but it feels sooooo good--as I removed all potential hazards from my surroundings. By the time I reached the end of the song the world would usually start moving again. Only once did I have to start the song a second time, when a big car pile-up turned out to be the catalyst for a gas station exploding. Another time the world decided to restart right in the middle of my mid-song dance routine. Prom photo, very awkward. <nl> I gently freed myself from Julia's embrace and moved away from the shoreline. I inspected the beach for poisonous animals. I Thought I spotted a jellyfish but it turned out to be a plastic bag. Binned the bag--choking hazard. I lay down next to Julia and finished my tune. I gazed at that beautiful face, hoping my face would be the first thing she saw when she woke up. Aaaaaand....nothing happened. <nl> I looked around. What had I missed? I doused the campfire. The surfer dude tending to it would probably be confused when time started again, possibly even angry, so I made sure to put some nice little plant product in his hands to distract him. Surfer dude had a dog, so I put it on a leash. But nope, nothing happened. <nl> I looked up. Was there a plane about to crash? I couldn't see any, but that didn't mean much at night. Speedboat accident? Tripping on a rock? Blood poisoning from a splinter? Over the next couple of hours I tried to take precautions for every hazard I could think of, but to no avail. I tried everything. Eventually, I gave up. There had to be *something*, but I just couldn't see it. Maybe I had to think bigger. An earthquake. Nuclear war. Maybe even an alien invasion. <nl> I knelt down next to Julia. She looked angelic. Sleeping beauty. And then it dawned on me. If there really was a big event about to happen, she would most likely die in that event as well. No! I couldn't let that happen! I stood up straight and shook my head. That wouldn't happen, I would make sure of that. I... I would simply not let time start up again. If I never removed the hazard that threatened my life, time would stay still forever, right? Julia would never die. She would--she would forever lie here on this beach, a sleeping angel in paradise. And I--I would be with her, forever. <nl> And I stayed with her. I talked to her, sang to her, combed her hair, ever so carefully brushed sand away from her face. She never stopped looking like an angel. I counted the circles in the sand. Three hundred and sixty-five. A year. Wow. Had it really been that long already? It was a good life, all things considered. Julia. The beach. Great weather. A gorgeous nightsky. Of all the moments someone could possibly get stuck in, this really was the best one. <nl> But then *he* had to come spoil it. He was hard to miss, being the only moving thing in the world other than myself. A skeletal figure in a black cloak, making his way down the beach as if he were on a casual sunday stroll. I briefly contemplated running away, but I couldn't do that to Julia. Besides, where would I go? So I waited. I waited for what seemed like an eternity, because he certainly took his sweet time to get here. But here he was now. My time had come. <nl> The gaunt figure stood before me, gazing at me with eyeless eyes. <nl> ""Death, I presume?"" My voice broke, and I hated myself for it. ""So, uh, so you finally caught me, huh?"" <nl> Death placed a skeletal hand on my shoulder and gave a small squeeze. <nl> ""No, John,"" he said. His voice was surprisingly warm and friendly. ""I already caught you a year ago. I'm here to tell you it's time to let go."" <eos>

Tails, a man is born good, full of righteousness. We go forth with free will, able to choose our own destinies, but underneath it all lies these base traits. The current of our soul pulling us towards ourselves. Many fight it and lose themselves in the process; they resist the call or cannot rise to the occasion.

","Good luck tomorrow and godspeed."" He said as he walked away, my bailiffs coming towards me. I took a deep breath. ""Thank you sir. I hope it's fast."" <nl> ""I'm sure it will be."" He called as he left the chamber. <nl> And my fingers tightened around the key they now held. <nl>",13,"<sos> "" 'God does not play dice with the universe.' Well of course not, the Universe is huge! He simply flips a coin. <nl> ""Heads, a man is born evil, lacking ethics and honor. Tails, a man is born good, full of righteousness. We go forth with free will, able to choose our own destinies, but underneath it all lies these base traits. The current of our soul pulling us towards ourselves. Many fight it and lose themselves in the process; they resist the call or cannot rise to the occasion. They awake on their death finding their lives to have passed in ritualistic automation. They are the core of our society, the backbone. Our mass produced machines built around interchangeable, uniform parts. So we grind the individuality out. <nl> ""Everyone is someone who just hasn't made it big. Someone with a great idea. Someone who can change the world. While our births come from coin flips, life is in fact played with dice. Weighted dice, but dice nonetheless. <nl> ""So I started my revolution. I found the others who hadn't been ground down yet. Who still clung to themselves in a sea of non-conformist conformers. We moved like the tide. Slow and steady. We gained power. We gained followers. Our protests exploded. Our voices grew louder. <nl> ""And nothing changed. <nl> ""We had no power and had no way to gain power. We were screaming into the night. A million voices wasted on a billion stars. <nl> ""I did what I had to and for that I hold no regrets. Our system is changing now. The masses are rising up. The machine is breaking down and the fires are burning. I don't matter anymore, only the blood that I have spilt does. The revolt will continue."" <nl> The Judge looked down upon me. Curiosity and disgust layered his eyes. I stood before him disheveled, exhausted, and grinning. His chest heaved as the air slowly passed his lips. The silence rung in the room. <nl> The Judge closed his eyes. The moment drew on and my heart held steady. ""Captain, have you any more to offer in your defense?"" His eyes a twisted mirth at our farce. <nl> ""No, your honor."" We knew this trial's fate. <nl> ""As you wish."" He nodded at me and stood ""Having heard all accounts and reviewed all evidence,"" his voice deep, echoing through the hall, ""I find the defendant, Captain Lennon of the Lonely Hearts, guilty of 60 counts of assault with a deadly weapon, 19 counts of mur-"" <nl> ""20!"" I interjected. <nl> ""Thank you. 20! Counts of murder, 3 assassinations, conspiracy to commit mass acts of terrorism, heresy against the God King, and high treason. In accordance with the law, the Captain is to be hung at high noon tomorrow in front of the castle. Court is adjourned."" His gavel came down and the crowd filed out. <nl>Good luck tomorrow and godspeed."" He said as he walked away, my bailiffs coming towards me. I took a deep breath. ""Thank you sir. I hope it's fast."" <nl> ""I'm sure it will be."" He called as he left the chamber. <nl> And my fingers tightened around the key they now held. <nl><nl> I returned to my chair and awaited the return to my cell. I was only to be moved when there was a minimal number of possible casualties. The Judge gathered his papers from his dais and approached the floor. His face was flat. No smile in his eyes or his lips. No frown in his jowls. But there was a gleam in his eyes. And his steps were the grace of a younger man. <nl> He stood above me, his stone face staring down at me. His eyes searching. ""You never said which side you fell on."" <nl> ""Hm?"" I raised my eyebrow in confusion. <nl> ""Your god's coin. You never said which side you fell on: the path of the righteous or the path of the honorless?"" His voice softer, the old man giving counsel. <nl> ""Do you need to ask your honor? On today of all days?"" <nl> His face began to crack. The edges of his lips pulled upwards. ""Especially today."" <nl> A new silence filled the room. And I saw the emptiness of my brethren before and the fire in them now. I saw the old, cold world clicking away and its jaunty, haphazard replacement. I heard the silence of the village street and the roar of artillery. I felt the hammer of tedium and the blood of the fallen. My life unfurled in that silence. <nl> I looked up and steadied my voice.

"<sos> ""... so I realized then and there, this was my best chance."" <nl> No one spoke after that. The only sound that could be heard in the room was the low crackle of a small fire. The stunned silence lasted for over a minute. <nl> *It's good to know my oratory classes have still taken. The lack of practice made me think -* <nl> The High Minister rose from his chair, ghastly white. <nl> *- aaaaand here we go.* <nl> ""But - the, the prophecy, Lady Ariana -"" <nl> ""*Queen* Ariana the First, High Minister. This is the Throne Room; if there's one place in the Kingdom where protocol must be followed, it's here."" <nl> ""You *dare* assume yourself a Queen?! After -"" <nl> I rose from my chair. Lazily. The effect was the same, and there was no reason to give this idiot the impression he was getting on my nerves. Which he was, but still. Protocol. <nl> ""I will not have you raise your voice to me when I'm sitting at my throne, High Minister."" I still gripped the sword in my left hand. I wasn't pointing it at him - the jagged tip was leaning at the floor, leaving a mark on the marble - but the message was clear. ""*Sit.*"" <nl> He sat. He blinked several times. Might have been centering himself, or might be holding back tears. The possibility of it being the latter pissed me off *far* more than the confrontation. <nl> I sat back, leaning at the throne in the laziest possible position, staring at a random spot at the back of the room. <nl> ""It really doesn't matter *how* the sucession -"" Everybody in the room flinched at that word, and I think one of the Generals even sobbed. *Good. I have to press my advantage and establish myself before one of these pricks decides to make a move to try and overthrow me.* ""- the *sucession* came to pass. I am the rightful heir, as it has been foretold and all that rot -"" <nl> ""The prophecy."" The High Minister chipped in. *Smarmy prick.* He must've felt emboldened by seeing everyone flinch. <nl> ""*Yes. High. Minister.* The prophecy."" <nl> ""Which you have broken. *Overturned.*"" He made the word sound like a malediction. <nl> I smiled internally. I had been waiting for that, and his timing couldn't have been better. <nl> ""Oh? Have I? I'm not so sure about that. Could you kindly recite it for us?"" *He's said it at least twice a day, every day, over the last twenty-odd years.* I smiled internally again. *How sweet it is to use it against him.* <nl> The High Minister looked thoroughly confused at that. He cleared his throat and, hesitantly, began reciting the words that sealed my fate until just two days ago. <nl> **""When He the Good King sires a Woman as his First Born Child, the Chosen Knight shall Rise.** <nl> **""When the First Woman is Kept By the Beast, the Knight shall Kill the Monster, and take the Throne as Prize.""** <nl> **""The Head of the Beast and the Sword of Great Might - as Proof of Conquered Right shall Suffice.""** <nl> ""Sounds correct to me. Head Scribe - is that correct?"" <nl> I knew it was, but to have his recitation questioned in front of everyone would offend the High Minister to no end. I have to admit, that one was purely out of spite. <nl> ""Y-yes. Yes, L-L-uh, Your Majesty."" I grinned a bit at that. <nl> ""Okay."" I got up from my chair and started waking as I spoke. I was originally going for the ""lazy and bored"" facade, but I was very excited about what would happen next. ""Let's go through that. Item by item. *He the Good King* refers to my father. We *all* know that."" I let some of the bitterness leak into my voice. ""I'm the First Born Child, and the Knight -"" <nl> ""Sir Galahad."" <nl> That was the third time the High Minister spoke out of turn. Even if I *didn't* want to hurt that *fucker*, he was basically challenging my claim to the throne at this point, and protocol is protocol. <nl> I raised my sword to a combat stance and marched right up to him. He stumbled out of his chair, backpedaling to the nearest wall, and I pressed on - when the Blade of Flame Everlasting was close enough to his face that his beard was starting to burn, I spoke. <nl> ""Three times you have raised your voice against me, *Anarius*. It is only in respect to oldest tradition that I not cross you through with this blade as you stand. But you are hereby dishonorably exonerated of all your duties as High Minister, and by your Queen's command you will *sit your ass on that fucking chair* and *keep your fucking mouth shut* and *do as you're fucking told!* If you interrupt me again, I'll let you keep company to your 'beloved friend' over there."" <nl> Even as he stared at me and at the sword, his eyes drifted to my right, to the spot by the throne where my father's corpse still burnt a faint ember. <nl> Anarius mewled something incomprehensible, and shambled right back to his seat. <nl> *Fuck, where was I again? I had the whole timing of the speech organized in my head - Sir Galahad. Okay. Moving on.* <nl> ""Alright. So, recapping. The Good King is my father, for all the 'good' he was, I'm the First Born Child... and then there's Sir Galahad. Previous owner of this fine blade."" I tapped the Flame Everlasting with my index. ""Let me tell you what all of you want to know but are way too afraid to ask. Let me tell you of the day before yesterday, when Sir Galahad marched up to the Lornis Castle and lifted the Flame Everlasting against Mollun, the Dragon, and the Beast of Prophecy."" <nl> I put on my most solemn face. <nl> ""He fucked it up completely."" <nl> I let that sentence hang in the air for a while. This speech was the only fun part of this whole fiasco, so I had to make as many dramatic pauses as I could get away with. <nl> ""He tried to challenge the dragon to fair combat. The five ton, twelve meters tall and twenty-five meters long flying lizard that does not possess the ability of speech. Sir Galahad walked right up to it and screamed at it to have it come out of its castle and fight him like a man. <nl> That worked exactly as well as you think it did. The dragon swiped its tail at Sir Galahad, who was bodily flung outside of the castle and very nearly died from the impact. By the time Galahad was on his feet again somehow, Mollun was already a mile high in the air, preparing to dive at him and crush him to death. <nl> Apparently, Sir Galahad was counting a tad too much on the fact that the Blade of Flame Everlasting can fight and defeat any flame, even the legendary Dragon flame. He seemed to have discounted, however, that dragons are in fact pretty large, and heavy, and apparently intelligent enough not to use fire against the one weapon in the world that could turn it against them. <nl> Galahad rose his sword to impale the dragon on its way down, and Mollun simply changed course mid-dive and slammed the ground right next to Galahad, who was immediately flung aside again and buried in the debris from the impact. <nl> This continued for some time. I believe Mollun was deriving great enjoyment from Sir Galahad's slow death."" <nl> Everybody present stared at me. The generals, the nobles, the pages and knights; even the servants stopped pampering their masters and kept their eyes riveted at me. The room was, somehow, even more silent than before. <nl> *Oh. My father stopped burning. That explains it.* <nl> ""As you may know, or have realized, Mollun was under a spell to 'protect' me. And part of that spell stipulated that Mollun could do me no harm as long as he lived. What happened next was rather simple; I walked up to Sir Galahad, took the Blade from his mangled hand, and ripped Mollun's throat open."" <nl> Some people gasped at that. I spared a look at Anarius. <nl> ""I assume that *that* is what you were referring to when you said I had... *overturned*... the Prophecy. Right, Anarius?"" <nl> His face tensed, but he did not reply. I permitted myself a grin. <nl> ""Now, see here, I was thinking the same thing myself on my way here. Maybe I could have just let Sir Galahad die an ignominious death, and let Mollun finish his destruction of one of the most valuable magical artifacts ever conceived."" I tapped the sword with my index again. ""But you know what? Nowhere in the Prophecy does it say the Knight and the Woman are two different people. It's implied, but it's never really said. It also never says that 'he' should marry me, even though my father promised my hand to whoever freed me from the prison *he* made for me."" <nl> My expression turned hard at that. ""Prophecies are always recorded in an ambiguous fashion, and are often misinterpreted, as the scholars know. But *my father* never cared about that. He never gave a *fuck*. Oh, no. *He* was being featured in a Prophecy, so it had to go *perfectly*, according to his fucking demented, obtuse, *fairytale* interpretation of it. So he built a prison for me. Locked me in there with nothing but books and a handful of enchanted artifacts to keep me company, for however long it took for the *Prophecy* to come true. Then he lured a Dragon from the Far Reaches all the way here. And sold several treasures from the Kingdom, to pay a mage to bind Mollun to the prison. And sacrificed our harvests, and our cattle, and some of our *people*, to keep that horror well fed and vigilant. And after twenty something years of *nothing but failure*, he gave the *most precious, irreplaceable artifact* in the Royal Armory to a *downright moron* in a desperate attempt to have the Prophecy fulfilled before he died. And here we are. Mollun is dead. Galahad is dead, and the Blade is broken in half."" <nl> I could hear my heartbeat, now. I realized the Throne Room was *even more silent*, and I knew it was because most people were holding their breaths. How many of them knew? How many here were innocent, and how many were complicit? And what was going through the minds of either group now, that the chips were down? <nl> I smiled. ""Thinking about that, I realized one more thing about the Prophecy, too."" <nl> ""The 'Monster'. 'The Knight shall Kill the Monster'... Not the Beast. The Monster. It's a different word. So I assume the Knight has to kill sometnhng - or someone - *other* than the Beast, for the Prophecy to be fulfilled."" I grinned. ""It might be a bit forced, but that's what I'm going with."" <eos>

"<sos> ""Stop and surrender!"" Sam could feel adrenaline surging through his veins from those words alone.

One of his arms was arched back, shuriken between fingers and ready for throwing. <nl> Since most of the people who happened to be in the bank at that time were lying on the ground, it wasn't hard for the three robbers to locate him.

"<sos> Sword pressed to his helm, the knight held his back steady against the giant bolder. His deep breaths were cut short by the explosion of flames just on the other side of the rock he hid behind. *Predictable,* he thought, as a bead of sweat began to form on his brow from the heat surrounding him. He took off running to his left, iron suit clanking with each step, sword dragging on the ground behind him as ran. The dragon's attention was on the rock; he would flank the beast and achieve victory all to easily. Or so he thought. The dragon screeched as a flame spewed from its mouth directly towards the knight. Eyes wide and in mid-sprint, the knight slid beneath the flames, his suit hitting the ground with a loud thud. The fire stopped and the knight scrambled to his feet to make his way towards the scorched ruins of a castle. The ruins were farther than he anticipated, but was able to reach the remains of what once was a column to hide behind. His breath heavy and his back against the stone once again, he waited for the beast to attack. Reaching for his sword, he realized he had dropped it in his attempt to dodge the fire. Weaponless, he leaned over to peer  around the column, raised his visor to have clear vision, only to see the empty landscape. The earth shook as the dragon landed squarely in front of the knight, he turned in shock, the dragon planted arms and legs on the ground, wings splayed, and bellowed a deep roar. The knight screamed. The dragon fell over on its side, laughing. <nl> ""Dang it, Carl! It is NOT funny."" <nl> The dragon could barely get a word out through his laughter. ""...your face,"" a tear weld up in his eye (and promptly evaporated), ""...but your face, it was just,"" the dragon held in a laugh for a moment to mimic the knight, opening his eyes wide and mouth agape, arms in the air; then burst with laughter once more. <nl> The knight rolled his eyes and began to remove his helmet. His hands were still shaking from nerves, but was finally able to unclasp the helm and remove it. By that time the dragon had sat himself upright, about twice as tall as the knight, his laughter somewhat subsiding. ""You cheated, by the way,"" the knight said. <nl> ""What, the fire thing?"" the dragon said with a scaly smirk on his face. <nl> ""Yes, the fire thing. You know you can't shoot fire at me when I'm not hiding behind something. You could have killed me."" <nl> ""Geoff, if I wanted to have killed you, you'd have been dead a long time ago, my friend. Plus, you have that fancy suit that so beautifully frames that scared little face of yours,"" Carl let out a few more laughs, smoke escaping his nostrils. <nl> ""This suit doesn't do anything but boil my skin whenever I'm near your fire. It's a safety hazard, really. I only wear it because all the townsfolk expect a knight to ride into battle with it. But it is extremely uncomfortable."" Geoff began to unbutton pieces of his armour. <nl> ""Heavy, too, I am guessing?"" Carl asked as Geoff nodded. ""I figured so when you flopped on the ground below my breath."" The dragon laughed once again. <nl> ""Excuse me, I *slid*. I slid valiantly!"" Both Geoff and Carl laughed at that. A piece of ash caught in the back of Carl's throat, turning his laugh into a brief cough, emitting tiny flames with each hack. <nl> An alien voice pierced the landscape: ""QUICKLY BROTHER, HIDE! I HAVE COME TO SLAY THIS DRAGON ONCE AND FOR ALL, IN THE NAME OF VALDOLLA!"" <nl> Geoff and Carl looked around to find the source of the voice, finding a man approaching from the distance on the other side of the column where they both stood. The man was dressed in all grey and was adorned with a cape and a sword. Carl looked at Geoff, ""what the heck is a Valdolla?"" <nl> ""Val's name is Valdolla. Just..."" Geoffey motioned a wave to Carl to back away and put on his helmet. ""UH, NO THANKS!"" he called back, ""I HAVE THIS HANDLED, THE BEAST IS DYING! I'VE ALREADY KILLED HIM!"" Geoff turned back to Carl, ""you're dying. Go die."" <nl> ""Well, that's unrealsti-"" <nl> ""Just do it!"" The dragon rolled his eyes and flopped on his side with a sarcastic moan. ""SEE? HE IS DEAD! YOU CAN GO HOME NOW! GO TELL EVERYONE HOW BRAVE I AM. KILLED THE DRAGON AGAIN.""  The man in grey made his way closer to Geoff and Carl, now in a sprint. Upon reaching the two, the man lowered his sword. <nl> ""You have killed him? Is it true?"" The man walked up to the dragon, prodding him with his foot. <nl> ""Um, yep, super dead."" Carl gave Geoff a stern look behind the man's back in response. <nl> ""Forgive me brother, but you seem to come slay a dragon very frequently,"" he said kicking the dragon as he walked around him. ""I am wondering if maybe not there are more dragons, but that this one just feigns death to live another day. We must be sure."" <nl> ""What?"" Geoff asked before he realized what had happened--the man had plunged his sword in to dragon neck. Carl flopped out of his death position and stood upright. <nl> ""*What the-""* Carl shouted along with a long roar in a surprised rage, the sword protruding from his neck. <nl> ""THE BEAST IS STILL ALI-"" the man began to exclaim, before the jaws of the dragon engulfed his body and, with one swift *crunch*, all that was left of the man were his two legs that stood there--bloody stumps. <nl> Geoff and Carl stared at each other. Carl promptly swallowing whole the man that was in his mouth. <nl> ""Val is going to kill us,"" Geoff said, breaking the silence after their long pause. ""You better clean this up."" <nl> ""*Me?""* <nl> ""Yes, you. You can't just eat every person who comes up here. We've talked about this."" <nl> Some moments passed as Carl finished disposing of the man in grey, and Geoff began to pull the sword from his friend's neck when Val arrived. <nl> ""Hey, guys, sorry I am late. What happened here?"" She said as she finished climbing over several large rocks, eyeing the sword protruding from Carl's neck as she approach the two sitting in the ruins. <nl> Geoff and Carl gave each other a look, and then Geoff responded first, ""oh, we were just sparring and I got the better of Carl here. Just got carried away."" Carl gave Geoff a look that said, *really?* Geoff shrugged in response. <nl> ""Well that seems unlikely, "" she replied. Carl gave Geoff a big smile, who rolled his eyes. ""Anyway, I met this bard at the tavern earlier. He seemed cool enough, so I invited him up here. I hope you guys don't mind. I figured we can put on a show and give him a good scare."" She noticed Geoff and Carl exchanging looks. ""What?"" <eos>

The man was dressed in all grey and was adorned with a cape and a sword. Carl looked at Geoff, ""what the heck is a Valdolla?"" <nl> ""Val's name is Valdolla. Just..."" Geoffey motioned a wave to Carl to back away and put on his helmet. ""UH, NO THANKS!"" he called back, ""I HAVE THIS HANDLED, THE BEAST IS DYING! I'VE ALREADY KILLED HIM!"" Geoff turned back to Carl, ""you're dying. Go die."" <nl> ""Well, that's unrealsti-"" <nl> ""Just do it!"" The dragon rolled his eyes and flopped on his side with a sarcastic moan. ""SEE? HE IS DEAD! YOU CAN GO HOME NOW! GO TELL EVERYONE HOW BRAVE I AM. KILLED THE DRAGON AGAIN.""  The man in grey made his way closer to Geoff and Carl, now in a sprint. Upon reaching the two, the man lowered his sword. <nl>The dragon could barely get a word out through his laughter. ""...your face,"" a tear weld up in his eye (and promptly evaporated), ""...but your face, it was just,"" the dragon held in a laugh for a moment to mimic the knight, opening his eyes wide and mouth agape, arms in the air; then burst with laughter once more.<nl><nl> ""You have killed him? Is it true?"" The man walked up to the dragon, prodding him with his foot. <nl> ""Um, yep, super dead."" Carl gave Geoff a stern look behind the man's back in response. <nl> ""Forgive me brother, but you seem to come slay a dragon very frequently,"" he said kicking the dragon as he walked around him. ""I am wondering if maybe not there are more dragons, but that this one just feigns death to live another day. We must be sure."" <nl> ""What?"" Geoff asked before he realized what had happened--the man had plunged his sword in to dragon neck. Carl flopped out of his death position and stood upright. <nl> ""*What the-""* Carl shouted along with a long roar in a surprised rage, the sword protruding from his neck. <nl> ""THE BEAST IS STILL ALI-"" the man began to exclaim, before the jaws of the dragon engulfed his body and, with one swift *crunch*, all that was left of the man were his two legs that stood there--bloody stumps. <nl> Geoff and Carl stared at each other. Carl promptly swallowing whole the man that was in his mouth. <nl> ""Val is going to kill us,"" Geoff said, breaking the silence after their long pause. ""You better clean this up."" <nl> ""*Me?""* <nl> ""Yes, you. You can't just eat every person who comes up here. We've talked about this."" <nl> Some moments passed as Carl finished disposing of the man in grey, and Geoff began to pull the sword from his friend's neck when Val arrived. <nl> ""Hey, guys, sorry I am late. What happened here?"" She said as she finished climbing over several large rocks, eyeing the sword protruding from Carl's neck as she approach the two sitting in the ruins. <nl> Geoff and Carl gave each other a look, and then Geoff responded first, ""oh, we were just sparring and I got the better of Carl here. Just got carried away."" Carl gave Geoff a look that said, *really?* Geoff shrugged in response. <nl> ""Well that seems unlikely, "" she replied. Carl gave Geoff a big smile, who rolled his eyes. ""Anyway, I met this bard at the tavern earlier. He seemed cool enough, so I invited him up here. I hope you guys don't mind. I figured we can put on a show and give him a good scare."" She noticed Geoff and Carl exchanging looks. ""What?"" <eos>

Na'thrar demanded, or tried to, as he knew how tricky dealing with their contact could be, and he himself was *very* wary of  box high qualityy fireworks his furry friend had strapped to his back. Even though their contact  guaranteed they would not explode until after they were little, one couldn't be too careful. <nl> The small, feline-eqsue creature replied between breaths ""Got... the goods. Higher..."" The little was fumbling with the strap of the pack, and with an irritated snort cut it clean off with a talon-like claw. ""Price than normal. Bad news though.

Na'thrar hissed, his tall slender from shaking with visible rage and fear. <nl> Kolfwel just eyed him as he stretched his aching back. ""Look. Not my idea. But I got what we needed, and stars know we need some muscle. He just told me to go on ahead while he packed his... ah what was the word... *essentials*. Look, there he is now."" <nl> Not that Na'thrar couldn't feel the minor walking earthquake that was their contact. Humans were built to withstand the higher gravity of their home planet, and it showed in the man striding toward them, with two duffel bags and a backpack slung across his back. Na'thrar judged him a bit taller than average, tanned and burned skin, a barrel chest, tree trunk legs and arms that could deliver devastating punches and kicks. Not nearly as devastating than the giant four armed Wouet, but a force to be reckoned with in his own right. <nl> But the most startling feature was his scarred and grizzled face. He had a long mane of shaggy black hair, a old burn scar that covered his left cheek and part of his throat, and a slightly deranged and haggard look in his right eye. His left had been replaced with a cybernetic. He looked like he hadn't slept or shaved in a couple days. <nl> As the human approached them, Na'thrar's old nervous tic of his left eye stalk came back, and he quashed it with an annoyed thought. But still, even dealing with brash, egotistical diplomats whose worlds had the power to shatter planets hadn't made him *this* nervous. It was just something... primal... about this walking mountain of muscle that made his skin itch, and made him want to crawl in a hole and hide. <nl> The man nodded to the little Yaruoan as he approached. ""Kolfwel. Thanks for letting me tag along."" The little cat like creature gave a shrug and a flick of his barbed tail. ""No prob. Just keep up your end of the bargain."" <nl> ""Will do."" He turned an appraising gaze on to Na'thrar, who swallowed unconscionably. ""So. You're the brains of this operation."" He said, craning his neck to look at the eight foot Trel'okian. humanoid in appearance, save for eerily slender height, an extra joint in each limb, and a slash for a mouth.

It's a... pleasure... to meet you?"" <nl> Randy just nodded and freed Na'thrar from his surprisingly gentle but firm grip. ""Likewise. I booked the cabin next to yours. If ya need me just knock."" He turned to stride off down the hallway, but Na'thrar need one key question answered. <nl> ""Um, Randy? Why are you, ah, accompanying us on our little tour?"" <nl> Randy paused for an uncomfortably long moment. Kolfwer's ears perked up and settled his green stilted eyes on randy's back.

Unsure of what to say, they both nodded. <nl> ""Well, any of you seen a one of those big fuckers take out an entire garrison of elite galactic militia, wielding a motherfucking *Howitzer* like a goddamned rifle?"" <nl> Both their jaws went slack. Kolfwel brought back a demo video of it from earth once. It was terrifying. <nl> Randy looked a them gravely. ""Rumors been flying around like hell recently.

"<sos> I woke up sitting in a dim room, my thoughts hazy as I slowly regained consciousness. Where was I? One moment, I had just been minding my own business reading a book in the park, the next I had felt a stinging pain at the back of my head before everything faded to black. I tried to move my arms, only to find that they were restrained behind me. This wasn't good. <nl> ""Well, well, well, our guest has finally woken up,"" I heard a voice call out from the shadows. <nl> Suddenly, I snapped awake and looked around the room wildly. There were six people standing in a semicircle in front of me, their faces barely visible. All of them mostly naked, all covered in blood and intestines wrapped around themselves. Skulls and animal corpses decorated the walls and ceiling of the room. A man wearing some kind of black dome helmet, who I could only assume was the leader, was looming over me and was holding a sharp knife in his right hand. Oh fuck.

I'm fully aware that I'm not the nicest person, but I'm pretty sure I haven't done anything that deserves being eviscerated. <nl> ""Ahh..I'm glad you asked,"" the man said, smiling a psychotic grin.

A sudden memory sprung up from my depths of my mind, one that I haven't thought about in centuries. No, it can't be that. Surely not, it would be too absurd. But I can't stop myself from asking anyway. <nl> ""...Are you talking about the Pastafarian Church by the priest Linguine from the village of Vox?"" <nl> There's an audible gasp from the other cult members. ""How could you possibly  know about the Founder?!"" hissed one woman. <nl> I stare back at them dumbfounded. ""What the fuck? Is that what all of this insanity is about? Because of a prank that I pulled 400 years ago?"" <nl> The man in the helmet grabs me by the front of my jacket. I can see fury in his eyes. ""What the hell are you babbling about, heretic?"" <nl> I stare back at him with disdain. ""You are completely delusional, you idiot.Back when I was still mortal, I did a prank for the ""Black Devil"" that you're referring to. I showed up  covered in spaghetti when a wolf pack arrived in the village and drove them out with a whip I made out of pasta. Then, I held an assembly,  told the chief that his new name was Linguine and put a ""holy"" colander on his head. After that, I left behind a stone tablet declaring to all the villages that they needed to offer sacrifices of pasta every year to the Black Devil or the beasts would return."" I shake my head in disbelief. ""It was just a dumb prank. I figured you would just forget about the whole thing in a few years. How the actual fuck do you get from there to human sacrifice?!"" <nl> I can feel the cults looking around nervously. Not surprising really. I've just revealed their entire religion to be a sham. ""Lord Priest, he's lying, right?"" one timid girl asks. <nl> I see the man in the helmet furiously glare at her. ""Of course, he's lying! Can't you recognize how he mocks us?! But I'm going to end his heresy right here and now!"" With one quick movement, he drove his knife through my throat. <nl> I glare at him as blood spews from the wound and gets all over my new jacket.

",I glare at him as blood spews from the wound and gets all over my new jacket.<nl>,8,"<sos> I woke up sitting in a dim room, my thoughts hazy as I slowly regained consciousness. Where was I? One moment, I had just been minding my own business reading a book in the park, the next I had felt a stinging pain at the back of my head before everything faded to black. I tried to move my arms, only to find that they were restrained behind me. This wasn't good. <nl> ""Well, well, well, our guest has finally woken up,"" I heard a voice call out from the shadows. <nl> Suddenly, I snapped awake and looked around the room wildly. There were six people standing in a semicircle in front of me, their faces barely visible. All of them mostly naked, all covered in blood and intestines wrapped around themselves.

"<sos> A grumpy fourteen year old sat at his kitchen table, devouring a pop-tart and scrolling through his texts. <nl> ""Happy birthday, kiddo!"" The boy's mother burst into the kitchen, a wide smile on her face. She ruffled his hair and plopped a wrapped gift down in front of him. <nl> ""Thanks, Mom."" He reluctantly grinned as he tore at the gift. An old video game case of his with a fifty dollar bill inside, and an envelope identical to the ones he'd received every birthday for the last seven years. He pocketed the cash and slid the envelop away from him. <nl> ""I don't want it."" He mumbled as he stood up and finished his pastry. <nl> A worry-some look came over his mother. ""What do you mean? He wrote it for you, baby, you've got four more of these waiting for you."" <nl> ""Ya, and I don't want any of those either..."" <nl> She sighed. ""Look, I know growing up without a father has been rough, but he left you these because he loved you,"" She held the envelope close to her chest. ""He loved you more than anything in the world."" <nl> ""Then why the fuck did he leave?!"" The boy was fuming now, and his mother had to block him from going out the back door. <nl> ""There's a lot you don't understand, but if you'd read the letters, I promise it'll make more sense.."" Tears welled up in her eyes. <nl> ""Mom! He left us both! He bailed, and because he managed to get himself killed you want to forgive him for abandoning us in the first place!"" He shoved past his mother and ripped the back door open. ""Why'd he adopt a fucking kid if he didn't plan to stick around?!"" <nl> He ran across the back yard and hopped over the fence, faintly hearing his mother calling after him. ""He loved us; he loved YOU!"" <nl> ______ <nl> His next birthday was much of the same: she presented him with both that year's envelope and the year prior, and he rejected it; shouting, tears, and an angry boy storming out of the house. <nl> The following year, he pretended to accept the envelopes, only to walk over to the stove and hold one over the flames. That was the only time his mother ever struck him; she punched him square in the jaw, weeping hysterically, and this time she's the one who stormed out. <nl> His seventeenth birthday came, but there were no gifts. No cash, no envelopes, and no birthday wishes from his mother that morning. He had crept up the stairs to her bedroom door, which was ajar, and peaked in -hoping just to tell her that he loved her before he left for school. She was laying across her bed, four envelopes strewn about the sheets, and sobbing heavily into her pillow. He rolled his eyes, snuck back downstairs, and left without a word. '*Why can't she let him go?*' He felt she had more love for the man who left her than she did for her own son. <nl> ______ <nl> The night of his eighteenth birthday he lay in his bed in a deep sleep; the booze he'd partaken in with his friends had knocked him right out. His dreams were marred by terrible scenes: A horrible car wreck, the sound of steel crashing and grinding; Bodies strewn about in the wet street, wailing out for help; A hospital bed, and the sound of a patient flatlining. <nl> He jumped out of his sleep; he was absolutely drenched in sweat, and his breathing was short and manic. The rain outside batted down steadily on the roof, and the sound soothed him a bit. He caught his breath and checked his phone: 4am. <nl> ""Happy eighteenth birthday."" He said to himself as he let his head fall back onto the pillow. <nl> He had just closed his eyes again when his phone began to vibrate violently on the night-stand, and he had initially mistaken it for thunder. It was a number he didn't recognize, so he ignored it, turned his phone to silent, and fell back asleep. <nl> He woke a few hours later with a headache and feeling particularly groggy, and he slowly made his way to the bathroom. After a short bout of vomiting, he splashed some water on his face and made his way back to his room. He noticed his mother's door was wide open and peaked inside. Empty. 'Weird,' He thought to himself. 'Her shift should have been up a few hours ago.' <nl> He returned to his room to check his phone and what he saw sent chills down his spine: seventeen missed calls and fourteen voicemails. He quickly opened up his voicemail, and he didn't even bother listening to any after the first. His mother had been in an accident and she was in the hospital. <nl> He'd sprinted the entire way there; he'd never ran so hard for so long in his life, and when he arrived he felt like he could keel over and die right there in the lobby. The nurse at the front desk went wide-eyed when he gave her his name, and asked him to sit down while she tracked down the doctor. He refused, and instead pace around for a few minutes until someone came to greet him. <nl> ""Clarence?"" An older, kind looking woman a white coat approached him. <nl> ""That's me! Where's my mother? Is she ok?!"" His face was full of fear. <nl> ""Clarence, I think we should have a seat."" <nl> ______ <nl> He stood over her inert body and held her cold hand in his. She had been dead for almost four hours, and he was overwhelmed by guilt. They had sent an officer to his house shortly after she was admitted, but after pounding on the door for nearly twenty minutes they assumed he wasn't home. They let him stay with her body for a few hours, before arranging a ride home for him. <nl> He thought about what the doctor had told him, the information only just registering in his mind, and his dream from the night before invaded his thoughts. '*A drunk driver fell asleep at the wheel and merged into oncoming traffic,*' He thought of the horrible accident from his dream. '*The driver hadn't been wearing a seatbelt and was thrown from the car, he died instantly.*' The body in the wet street. '*Your mother fought valiantly, and we did all we could, but we lost her.*' The horrible, piercing noise of someone flatlining in the hospital. <nl> ____ <nl> He sat in his empty kitchen for a while; tears streaming down his face, and wished to hear his mother's voice wish him happy birthday. Eventually, he made his way up the stairs without any real thought behind his actions -he felt as if his mind had been unplugged, and he was now incapable of truly willing himself to do anything specific. He trudged passed his own bedroom door and stopped just in front of his mother's room. A chill came over him, the thought of this room now being inhabited engulfed his mind. His arm raised to shut the door, but he stopped when he spotted six envelopes on the bed. <nl> 'Six?' He thought to himself. 'There were only five more from him...' <nl> Hesitantly, he crossed the threshold into her room, and stood over the bed. Five letters near the foot of her bed, and one resting near her pillows. This one was unique, and his mother's hand writing spelled out his name. He opened the envelope, pulled out the letter folded inside, and read its short contents: <nl> *Clarence,* <nl> *I love you, and if you love me too, I know you'll do this one thing for me. Please, read them.* <nl> *I'll always be with you, Mom.* <nl> He set down his mother's final words to him with care, and moved to the other five letters.  Picking up the envelope labeled '*Fourteen*', he tore it open and pulled out the sheet of paper. Blank. He flipped it over and back multiple times, confused, and ran his fingers inside the now empty envelope. He moved to the next envelope '*Fifteen*', and ripped it open. Blank. <nl> '*Sixteen*', blank. <nl> '*Seventeen*', blank. <nl> He came to the final envelope, opened it, and this time pulled out a sheet of paper covered front to back in handwriting. Joyous for something, he began to read: <nl> *Clarence,* <nl> *If you're reading this, which I know you will be, then I've been dead for some time now, and your mother has just passed away. I know life has been hard without me there, and I know you've been taking it out on your mom for some time now, but just know, that we both forgive you. There's really nothing to forgive, in fact, because the position we put you in is a most unfair one. I'll do my best to explain, and I hope you'll understand.* <nl> *When I was a young man, freshly eighteen like yourself, I developed an amazing ability. I can see things, Clarence, things yet to pass; some are possibilities, and some are utmost certainties. This ability, as spectacular as it may be, has put our family in grave danger. I should have never conceived a child, I know that now, and I think I knew it all along, but I was selfish. Clarence, you're not adopted -you are our son. Our son in both love and biology, and you share my gift.* <nl> *The adoption was a lie, and one we had to go to great lengths to ensure that the world perceived as truth. My gift should have remained a secret, but I was foolish, and my recklessness put a target on my back. There are forces out there that would see me dead, and others that would see me to an even worse fate. We had to protect your true identity, as my biological son, because if they knew then they would pursue you relentlessly.* <nl> *Even after all the precautions we took; I knew I couldn't stay with you both, I saw it, and I had no choice but to leave. I know what you're thinking 'Why didn't I stop her death?'. Well, son, it doesn't work like that. Death always finds us in the end, and attempting to prolong the inevitable always leads to more suffering.* <nl> *But, there is much we can change, and I couldn't let you fall into the hands of those who would exploit your gift. Son, I know this is overwhelming, but if you cultivate your mind you will be able to do extraordinary things -far more than I could have ever hoped to accomplish.* <nl> *The future is not set in stone, and how you proceed from here is up to you; However, should you need some direction, head to the address inside in the envelope, and tell em I sent you.* <nl> *I've seen so many possibilities for who you become, Clarence, and I'm proud of each and every one of them.* <nl> *I'll always love you, Dad.* <nl> /r/BeagleTales <nl> **See my comment down below for info on part 2!** <eos>

"<sos> Back in Ancient Rome, sometime before Jesus was born, there was a myth circulating, and it went something like this: if you should be awake for the entirety of seven days and seven nights, you might see the silhouette of a dead man walking the street. And if you do... *run*. <nl> They called him Insomnis -- *the sleepless one* -- and it is said he found a way to talk to the Gods. <nl> Back when Insomnis was still a man, he swore he would find a way to reach the Gods and be with them always. He believed that the way to the Gods was not through worship, but through dreams, and so he trained himself to control his mind during his sleep; to control his existence inside his dreams. For seven years he explored the constraints of the night realms, finding -- probing -- the edges and limits. It is said the Gods warned him, told him that he must look no further, for there are realities that are not meant for mortals; truths that are sealed in the darkness and locked away in the void. But he did not listen to their warnings and instead was encouraged by them. He saw it as a test of faith that they had set him. He began to drug himself, ensuring the deepest of sleeps known to the Romans. His control of his dreamstate grew ever stronger, and the borders of the night realm began to weaken before him; cracks and fissures appeared that he battered his mind against until they grew into a hole he could slip through. <nl> What he saw there is unclear in the stories, but they all agree he drifted into the Bacchanalian realm of the Gods. There, he saw a vision not meant for our kind; *he saw into the eyes of Jupiter himself*, and Jupiter was displeased with him. Jupiter told him that next time he slept, because of him, the lights of existence would be extinguished. <nl> He woke in a fit, screaming and sweating blood. From that moment, he resolved never to sleep again - he never dared to shut his eyes and even ripped off his eyelids for fear of falling. But as time passed and his madness grew deeper, both his body and mind faded to a place between the realms of the Gods and the planes of the mortals, until he existed *nowhere*, except in the glimpses of our madness. <nl> I mention this story because I haven't slept in eight nights now. I mention it because *Insomnis* whispers to me as he sits on the end of my bed, his red pupils pulsating in the darkness of his silhouette. He tells me that the stories were wrong; it wasn't the Gods that drove him insane. There was something far worse than they, that he began to see in his waking hours. The Gods of the Gods. A reality beyond reality. <nl> He says now that I know about them, the maintenance  men will come for me; that I can never sleep, or they will catch me.  That existence will be snuffed like a candle, should I sleep. <nl> He hands me the knife and tells me I cannot go back; I cannot sleep again. He stretches my eyelid out, and with a trembling hand, I raise the knife and cut. <nl> --- <nl> more of my stories on /r/nickofnight <eos>

"<sos> When I was a teenager my mother asked me what I thought love was. Having just ended what I believed was my first real relationship. Completely distraught, dazed by the haze of infatuation I told her it was about feeling whole. About finding that one person who complements your faults. Who lifts you up and makes you feel like a better person. I was completely unaware that love was two sided. Could only see it for how it affected my own well-being. Or presumptive well-being. <nl> She asked me again nearly a decade later, after telling her I was planning on asking my then girlfriend to marry me. And I told her it wasn't about finding someone to complement your faults, but finding someone who was wholly compatible with the basic structures of my personality. That we could have major disagreements, but that so long as we agreed on the tenets of our own personal progress, and agreed to work together in tandem, we could overcome anything. <nl> That relationship fell apart a few months before the wedding. We realized that compatibility doesn't imply love. That we respected each other, and liked each other, but weren't in love. And like so many people I began to question whether love was actually tangible. Like other ephemeral ideas, maybe it was something that could be such a common trope but something nearly impossible to experience. The mere limitations of language pushing a narrative of something that was so deeply personal, it couldn't be adequately defined. <nl> I first met Anne about six months ago. We had had a series of arguments about how to pinpoint an anniversary. The kind of relationship that just kind of happens, and before you know it you're staring into the eyes of someone and it just feels right. Or so you think. From the moment I met her, I knew we were doomed. But it felt good so I went along with it anyways. Anne was a highly acclaimed theater actor, and refused to ever talk about it. Pretended like her celebrity status didn't exist. <nl> So, I buried it down, pretended like I never knew. Would occasionally hint at it, but she would immediately retreat. And that's when it fully dawned on me. Love is vulnerability. Love isn't some grand gesture, it isn't some heartfelt feeling, or shared experience. It's the ability to truly be vulnerable with someone. To escape millions of years of evolution. To allow someone else to define their experience of your being. That we spend so much time manicuring this image of ourselves and how we portray it to other people. Love is dropping all pretenses about how you think someone will judge you. <nl> She first told me she loved me about a month after we met. And I reciprocated. My mind turning through something that seems so easy for other people to understand. She probably noticed my insincerity. About a month ago she finally invited me to a work event, which turned out to be the opening night of her new play. Surprised me as we stepped out of the limo to the cheering crowds of people. I acted surprised, and she seemed to play long. For the first time, she smiled at me with complete sincerity. And it felt good. <nl> We broke up a few days later. My mother asked me what had happened and I explained that I just didn't love her. That if it took her six months to finally admit something so basic, that our future would just be battle after battle. Trying to crack through the surface. For the first time, I asked her what *she* thought love was. Because obviously, I was doing it wrong. She told me that she didn't actually care about love. That at the end of the day if you needed to use it as a crutch to justify a relationship it was probably doomed anyways. <nl> And I realized that I have no clue what love is. But that maybe that was okay. <nl> ________________________________________ <nl> ^^/r/squidcritic <eos>

"<sos> ""We have come to conquer. Surrender unconditionally to us, and we shall grant you the mercy of a life free of pain under our rule - fight, and your only mercy shall be that you will eventually die."" <nl> The broadcast had been sent over all forms of light speed communication, received by thousands if not millions of inhabited worlds. The ambassadors of the United Civilizations Council had gathered to discuss their plan of action - no less than two dozen different species, gathered to discuss their response to the outright declaration of war. <nl> Councilman Abnoor of the Geth paused the recording, his headplates shifting. ""They call themselves the Grox, and appear to be the ones nominally in charge of the center of the galaxy. It appears that a few years ago they began to take notice of our branch of the Milky Way being colonized, and spied on us for a while before deciding on a hostile takeover."" <nl> ""What do we know of this... Grox empire?"" One of the other councilmen asked, one of his long appendages gesturing at the squat, armored red figure on the screen. ""Surely some information must have been passed through by merchants from within the galaxy center."" <nl> Abnoor's visual light dimmed. ""Nothing good, unfortunately. Carnivorous and highly aggressive, they either enslave or subjugate those they come across. Any species who engage them in combat are crushed under their overwhelming numbers, and they seem to take pleasure in... consuming their defeated enemies, often times demanding tithes of live subjects from their conquered enemies."" <nl> ""Carnivores."" The Saurian councilmen muttered, his long neck swaying. ""Any species that eats meat ends up being war-mongering and aggressive, too blinded by their bellies to see sense -"" The councilman next to him cleared his oral pathways loudly, before gesturing with his head to a councilman across the room who was watching bemusedly. <nl> ""Ah!"" The saurian said, skin colorizing due to rapid bloodflow. ""I meant pure carnivores, of course. Omnivores are distinctly different -"" <nl> The Human delegate - not a full council member yet, due to their relatively new status as a space-faring race - raised in appendage in a manner that the translators said was meant to be calming. ""No harm meant, Ambassador Anglisaur. You're not wrong - humans as a whole tended to be warmongering until a few centuries ago. A desire for meat wasn't our main concern, but our hunter ancestry may have had something to do with it."" <nl> Abnoor hummed, rotating several disks rapidly. ""The Grox appear to have done extensive scouting using hitherto unknown stealth technology, ambassador Shepard. They appear to have been scouting for the weakest civilizations to stage their conquest from - and I'm sorry to say that your relatively small size and comparatively primitive spacecraft have made you a prime target. They appear to be willing to attack you first."" <nl> The pink-skinned mammal jolted in his chair, then opened his mouth in a manner meant to show... joy? <nl> No, that was a threat display, the baring of teeth. Abnoor's technological background meant it didn't have much in the way of the predator/prey instincts, but the rest of the council had no such restrictions. They were all herbivorous species, and recoiled from the predator species bringing its biological weapons to bear - even the Saurian, who was easily six times Shepards size, leaned away from the Omnivore. <nl> ""They chose us as the weakest? Hm. Their threat rankings must be flawed."" He stood from the chair, bowing in a low manner meant to show respect. ""If the people of the council would excuse me, we need to begin preparations."" <nl> ""Ambassador Shepard, will you be requiring assistance? We haven't needed to use out fleet in millennia, but -"" One of the ambassadors said, warily, but was cut off. <nl> ""We would appreciate any material support you could provide, but honestly?"" He turned, flashing his fangs again. <nl> ""Just stay out of the system for now - you're in the splash zone."" <nl> ----- <nl> Red lights blared, casting the hallway in a ghastly tone. J'In'Mal, Forward Admiral of the Grox, glared up at the damned lights as he turned down the corridor to the bridge. At least the combat alarms had stopped blinking, but the lights were getting annoying. <nl> His tail thrashed behind him as he entered the bridge, his subordinates baring their throats to him as he entered. ""Report, Captain."" <nl> ""Admiral, Sir! We exited subspace approximately six million kilometers away from the targeted planetoid, designated 'P-3', exactly five minutes ago. No less than six seconds later, the fleet was bombarded with high velocity impact rounds that destroyed shields within three or four impacts. The rest of the fleet was continually fired upon until their ships were destroyed, with all hands lost. Time from arrival to destruction of last ship was no more than forty seconds, sir. We were then fired upon with precision energy weapons until our thrusters were destroyed."" <nl> ""Egg-scum."" He muttered quietly. ""The fuck kind of weapons can destroy Class-Six shields in under a minute?"" <nl> ""We aren't sure, sir, but scans indicate they were some sort of hyper-velocity mass weapons, fired by using the orbit of their suns gravitational pull."" <nl> ""What..."" He started, then stopped, swallowing. His tail thrashed agitatedly, but then stopped as he focused. <nl> High velocity impact projectiles, fired using the natural gravitational pull caused by stellar bodies - like aiming a comet at his ships. Dozens of them, fired at once, while his ships had just exited warp and were unable to move. <nl> The flagship shook suddenly, and he was forced to spread his stance to keep his balance. ""The hell was that, Captain?"" <nl> ""Sir, we're..."" The Captain frowned, confused. ""We're being boarded."" <nl> The men around them gaped in shock. The Grox, being boarded? What kind of idiotic race would even bother to do such a thing? Space combat was no place for boarding maneuvers, and not even the Grox bothered with infantry combat outside of subjugation missions. <nl> ""They left us dead in the water, killed our shields, disabled our weapons, and now they dare to board us?"" He flexed his claws, spittle hissing from his jaw as he turned to the bridge door. ""These filthy plant eaters dare to -"" <nl> There was the sound of a metallic clang, and a sudden 'boom' as the door imploded inwards. The speed of the explosion caused the door to sail inwards, and J'In dove to the side - but the Captain behind him was not so lucky, and the speed of the door took his head clean off his shoulders. <nl> Admiral J'In'Mal was leader of his clan. he had slain dozens of challengers before he even fully matured, and brought down a desert dragon bare-handed for his ritual of adulthood. He pulled his axe from behind his back, preparing to meet the invaders hand-to-hand - <nl> **THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.** <nl> Only to meet his own haze in a black, reflective visor. The visor was attached to a domed helmet, which was attached to a massive, hulking suit of armor easily twice as tall as he was, and it's footsteps as it advanced rang across the metal floor with an echo that filled the throne room. It was groxoid and held a massive rifle in its hands, and attached to one wrist was a giant blade of some sort that whirred as blades spun across its surface. <nl> One of the soldiers roared, pulling a decorative sidearm and firing at the armored suit as it entered. The energy rounds glanced off of the suit without even leaving a mark, and the figure swung the bladed wrist down. <nl> The soldiers legs fell to the ground as its torso sailed across the room, the ground around him stained purple with blood. <nl> *They made suits designed for infantry combat. What species is crazy enough to seek out infantry combat against a predator species?* J'In thought, jaw clenched. <nl> The armored form, upon seeing that none of the other soliders were willing to assault it, entered - followed by five others of its kind, who paraded through the door way, training weapons on the men within. <nl> J'In growled, but sank to his knees and raised his chin, baring his throat. <nl> There were more footsteps, softer this time, and a small, slight figured entered the room. An unarmored member of the species - Humans? - strode in, clad only in soft fabrics that appeared decorative in nature. It turned to the blood-covered armored unit, saying a few words his translator didn't pick up, then shrugged. <nl> ""I can't believe we're the ones saying it, but I suppose this is fitting -"" She said, baring her teeth mockingly. ""But I suppose this means that 'all your base belong to us.'"" <nl> ""This is it?"" She asked, raising an arm. ""Our first real battle as a species, and what - three hundred ships destroyed in a minute, and no more than six dozen casualties when we board? Pathetic."" She ignored the communal growling of the men around her, but one of the armored forms kicked out, knocking a soldier to the ground. They fell silent. <nl> ""We were so prepared for war, you know. When we discovered there was life out there, we passed an edict not to travel any further so as to not draw attention to ourselves. We abandoned colonies, retreated to the core system, and started stockpiling - building better weapons, researching and spying on other species. We were prepared to enter what may very well be a fight for the survival of our species - but then we left the core and ventured out, only to find out that our wing of the universe was populated with tree-eating hippies. Bah. Centuries of preparation, wasted. But then you come along! Singing promises of our destruction and imminent death, a fleet to blot out the sun - and done, within five minutes. Typical man - just enough to get me hot, then done before I am."" <nl> She came to a stop before him, grabbing him by the chin and tilted his head up to look at him. <nl> ""Pathetic."" She muttered. ""Very well. You Grox wanted war?"" <nl> Her teeth glinted. Flat in the back, to crush grass or bone. Pointed in front, to rip and tear. <nl> ""You got your war. Enjoy it while you can."" <eos>

It turned to the blood-covered armored unit, saying a few words his translator didn't pick up, then shrugged. <nl> ""I can't believe we're the ones saying it, but I suppose this is fitting -"" She said, baring her teeth mockingly. ""But I suppose this means that 'all your base belong to us.'"" <nl> ""This is it?"" She asked, raising an arm. ""Our first real battle as a species, and what - three hundred ships destroyed in a minute, and no more than six dozen casualties when we board? Pathetic."" She ignored the communal growling of the men around her, but one of the armored forms kicked out, knocking a soldier to the ground. They fell silent. <nl> ""We were so prepared for war, you know. When we discovered there was life out there, we passed an edict not to travel any further so as to not draw attention to ourselves. We abandoned colonies, retreated to the core system, and started stockpiling - building better weapons, researching and spying on other species. We were prepared to enter what may very well be a fight for the survival of our species - but then we left the core and ventured out, only to find out that our wing of the universe was populated with tree-eating hippies. Bah. Centuries of preparation, wasted. But then you come along! Singing promises of our destruction and imminent death, a fleet to blot out the sun - and done, within five minutes. Typical man - just enough to get me hot, then done before I am."" <nl> She came to a stop before him, grabbing him by the chin and tilted his head up to look at him. <nl> ""Pathetic."" She muttered. ""Very well. You Grox wanted war?"" <nl> Her teeth glinted. Flat in the back, to crush grass or bone. Pointed in front, to rip and tear. <nl> ""You got your war. Enjoy it while you can."" <eos>

"<sos> Okay Chet, time to crush this exam. <nl> First Question: <nl> **What is the greatest speed achievable in the universe?** <nl> Well, my 'Stang red-lines at 126 mph. Nothing is faster than that. <nl> Just when I was about to get to question 2, everything slammed against the  wall. It was just like when I slammed on the brakes after doing a bunch of donuts in my Mustang. But like, if *everything* had the brakes slammed on. The teacher told us to not worry about the test, because that had to be a terrorist attack or something. Just stay put and wait for the cops to rescue us. I'm no pussy. I don't need to get rescued and terrorists don't scare me. I told the teacher I would kick some terrorist butt and he would have to give me an A in the class. He started to mouth off, but then he remembered that that was the rule. Stupid teacher. I got outside, and it was night-time. But it shouldn't be night-time. The street-lamps weren't even on. Luckily, I have a flashlight-key-chain. I turned it on, and... I could see the light leave. Like, normally, it just lights-up whatever right away, but now it looked like water coming out of a fire-hose... but with light. Weird. <nl> Just then, a group of terrorist just popped out of nowhere. I knew they were terrorists because they looked just like the bad-guys in 24. I had no idea that terrorists had teleporters. Probably stole them from the army. Then they saw me and started reaching for their weapons. But I busted some Kung Fu I saw in a sweet movie one time and sent them all flying on their butts. I always thought I'd be able to do Kung Fu if I really had to. <nl> I found the lead terrorist and said, ""Surrender. My name is Chet Huntington III and I make the rules."" I don't know why I said that. Just sounded bad-ass. and then I reached into my back-pocket, pulled out a Naddie Light, and shot-gunned it while the army teleported in to take the terrorists away. <nl> Then some geezer in a lab-coat grabbed me and told me I was messing with the laws of physics. I said, ""Whatever, Bill Nye."" And it was Bill Nye. But it wasn't before. And that's when I realized... anything I say becomes true. I am... The One. <eos>

"<sos> I was never a brave kid. Always afraid of everything, as if the whole world was going to come and harm me. I spent days huddling underneath a pillowfort in my bedroom, flashlight in hand, trying to keep out the dark. My parents didn't know what to do, but my grandfather, a man who had travelled the world, had an idea. He put my on his knee, and told me that the best way to stop being scared of something, was to become its friend. He told me to be nice and friendly with the darkness. <nl> I knew this was a silly thing to do, but scared witless, I tried anyway, sitting in my room wearing my bunny pyjamas, gently talking to the darkness, telling it about my day. To my surprise, when I treated the darkness as a comforting friend, as a someone who would hide me from all the dangers of the world, it didn't seem so bad. In time, I considered, as silly as it was, the darkness to be one of my few friends. The darkness, though on some level, what was hiding in it, scared me, became a comforting velvet blanket covering me. <nl> I grew from a nervous and scared child, to an anxious and cautious teenager, into a careful and prudent young woman. Throughout my life, I kept being friendly with the darkness, out of habit, and because a part of me still feared things. I was still the same scared little girl on the inside, worried about everything. But I could deal with it. <nl> I was walking back from the library in the evening, back to my dorm room at college. I'd been reading an interesting book about early software development and electric security, and had completely lost track of time. I usually walked home earlier, but I wasn't as afraid as I could be, the darkness was my friend after all. Someone was walking behind me, and my brain, ever on the watch against potential dangers, told me to walk faster. <nl> To my immediate horror, he started to walk faster too. I tried to shake him, tried to run, but he rushed me, and grabbed a hold of my arm, and swung me into a dark alleyway. Terrified, I became completely still, like a deer in the headlights. But as he pulled out a knife, he stepped into the shadow of the alley. And as he did, the darkness moved. He dropped his knife but it was too late, the darkness flowed like water onto his body, until he was covered completely. He screamed and tried to run, but the darkness, covering him from head to toe, just became a slight bit darker around him, as he vanished. <nl> I was shocked, as the shadows moved towards me. But it was like being submerged in cool refreshing water, yet it was quite easy to breathe in. And in the darkness, there was something soft and fuzzy. It took my hand in its massive darkness, and led me on a path I could not see. I can't tell for how long we walked together. I can't remember saying anything. I don't know where we went, but when we stopped, and the shadows disappeared, we were in my dorm room. I turned and looked around the room, and in one corner, there was a thicker clutch of darkness, one part of the dark which looked infinite. I walked over to it, and reached my hand into the dark, until I found that fuzzy soft feeling again. I gently touched this dark ambient sensation, and thanked it quietly, by whispering into that darkness. <nl> Ever since then, I have not feared the darkness. For wherever I walk, it follows me. I am the only friend of the darkness, its shape huge and dark, fuzzy, soft and strange. For my kind words, for my caring, I have a friend now, who will protect me from every horror that I fear in this world. I walk with it on moonless nights, in dark forests and across black oceans. I speak softly to the darkness, which listens to me. It has no voice, but it holds my hand safely in its enormous one, and I know that this is its way of comforting me, the same little girl in a pink bunny pyjamas, who spoke softly into the darkness. <nl> [/r/ApocalypseOwl](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApocalypseOwl/) <eos>

"<sos> The shop was quiet. The shop was always quiet. That's what Ms. Fields loved most about her quaint antique store. That and the idea that all the undiscovered treasures filling each of its crevices were tucked safely away--which includes the ones in the Devious category, and the Dangerous category. These pieces, of course, didn't have these labels of caution on them. That was part of the rules when she took ownership of this shop. Part of His rules. <nl> But Ms. Fields knew which pieces held which kind of powers; she knew the inventory like the back of her hand. Some were helpful, pleasant, desirable, bringing owners unexpected good luck or joy; others were menacing, treacherous, dangerous, even lethal. There would be no way to tell what you were getting when you selected one, and she wasn't allowed to reveal anything to customers. Each piece looked as it should. And each piece always made its way back, bad or good. That was part of the rules too. <nl> The bell above the door rang. Ms. Fields was sitting back in her chair, reading a book at the desk. <nl> ""Hello,"" she called without looking up at them. There was a table adjacent to the entrance that was filled with items, which obstructed the entire view of emerging customers. She had been meaning to clear this table or move it but hadn't gotten around to it yet. The camera display on the computer monitor in front of her would have revealed two men dressed conspicuously in black jackets, heads down with ballcaps on their skulls, if Ms. Fields had only bothered to glance at it. She was immersed in her novel; she'd get a good look at them when they were wandering the store. <nl> They did not reply to her. But she heard one mutter quietly to the other, ""It's in the back.

In the quiet of the store, she heard everything. <nl> She heard the men make their way through the store and watched them from the camera display. The men didn't browse or stop to look at any of the pieces on the shelves. They had come for something in particular. Ms. Fields put down her book, excitement taking over as to what they had come for. They neared the back of the store. Her heart sank. A gasp escaped. Not that one. Not that piece. No. Put it back. Please. <nl> She watched the two men count down and then lift the old grandfather clock from its place, each grabbing an end. They lumbered it back the way they came and stopped behind a shelf that was a few feet from where Ms. Fields sat. One of them knelt down and seemed to unzip his jacket pocket and then pull something out. He kept it concealed. He reached in again and pulled out a black rag. He pulled it over his face. She watched him on the screen about to emerge from behind the shelf. She looked up. <nl> The man's ballcap was pulled down far enough that she could barely see his eyes behind that mask. There was dust caked on his torso and abdomen. She never dusted the thing (that wasn't part of the rules), hoping browsing eyes would pass over it, perhaps not even notice it. It was so perpetually dusty that the clock looked like it was part of the store, a vital component, like the desk she sat at. She hoped customers would think it not for sale. But here were two men--likely not customers at all--that wanted the damned thing. Damned it was. <nl> ""May I help you?"" Ms. Fields asked. <nl> ""Yes, you can. Me and my partner are going to take that old dumpy grandfather clock you keep in the back. And you're gonna let us do it.

The man stuffed the pistol back into his pocket and spun around and went back to his partner. <nl> ""Three... two... one..."" <nl> The pair grunted and lifted the clock, the strain of the weight perceptible in their bodily movements despite the heavy layers of clothing covering their skin. They each shot a glare at Ms. Fields as they walked past. <nl> ""Take care,"" she said. <nl> Ms. Fields supposed if it *was* the piece's time to go, then there could be no better scenario than it being stolen. At least then it was in the hands of evil persons, rightfully so; and innocent customers would not have the opportunity to stumble upon it while it was away. <nl> That grandfather clock was evil. It was the most vile, despicable, unholy piece she owned. He himself had created it. Its spirit was black, and after it was finished swallowing these two into that blackness, it would find its way back. <nl> The thought made Ms. Fields shudder. She wished she could just be rid of the thing. But that would be breaking the rules. And when one makes a deal with the Devil, they don't break the rules. That was the price of immortality. <nl> At least she had a moment away from it. She looked back down at her novel and continued reading. <eos>

"<sos> How could this be? I had, to my knowledge, never done anything evil. Maybe this will sound crazy, but I had never done anything serious to harm anyone else. A consequence of that lifestyle choice was that I mostly kept to myself. It wasn't that I was some altruist, it was more that I was selfish in an unconventional way. I wanted the internal superiority that comes from knowing that no matter what, I wasn't a bad guy. It's a bit indulgent, sure, but enough to land me here for 186,292 years? That seemed excessive. <nl> ""Excuse me, is there someone I can speak to?"" The clerk hardly looked up from his desk. I asked again and the tips of his wings twitched. I had annoyed him. ""There must be some mistake,"" I continued. <nl> This last statement had gotten his attention, he now stood tall in front of me, and for the first time I got to appreciate the true spectacle that is an ""Afterlife Senior Administrator."" Standing nearly 10 feet tall, as wide as my dad's oak desk, with expansive wings whose tips reached down to his heels. He peered through comically small spectacles at me, his eyes almost bulging out in disbelief. Or was it mere annoyance? <nl> He opened his mouth and a roar upended the stillness around me. ""We make no mistakes. I've been doing this for as long as your kind has existed, i have never once seen a mistake, let alone made one."" He huffed and puffed as I carefully considered my next words. <nl> ""Of course, I understand. But is it possible?"" The words seemed not to anger him further, but neither did they calm him. He strode over to the file cabinet while mumbling something about how humans always amaze him with their self-centeredness. <nl> ""No!"" he said, as he pulled out a folder. Here you will find a description of your life, followed by the relevant info. The first section describes your characteristics, aptitudes, estimates, etc. The second describes and lists your good deeds, as well as the weight they carried. The third section does the same, for the bad deeds.

""Is it usually this thin?"" I asked. He did not even look up as he shook his head, then found his chair again, and sat back down with a crash. At least he was now calm. <nl> I flipped to the final section, looking at the summary. It said I had done 432 good things in my life, and only 14 bad things in my life. The net sum of all the bad things netted me a ""Evil Score"" of only -14, while the good things I had done had netted me a ""Goodness Score"" of 1312. Clearly, the good had outweighed the bad. <nl> ""Look right here!"" I said excitedly, feeling confident once more.""You made a mistake. I did more good things than bad, by a wide margin.""

Maybe threatening to bring in his supervisor would make this easy. <nl> The being laughed. It was an arrogant laugh that filled me with the feeling I was not out of this just yet.

You are here my dear human, because you were the first prophet to come around in a few millennia. All you had to do was follow your true nature, be open and receptive to THE WORD, and you would have done incredible good. You would have changed mankind, perhaps liberated it once and for all.

Maybe threatening to bring in his supervisor would make this easy. <nl>",5,"<sos> How could this be? I had, to my knowledge, never done anything evil. Maybe this will sound crazy, but I had never done anything serious to harm anyone else. A consequence of that lifestyle choice was that I mostly kept to myself. It wasn't that I was some altruist, it was more that I was selfish in an unconventional way. I wanted the internal superiority that comes from knowing that no matter what, I wasn't a bad guy. It's a bit indulgent, sure, but enough to land me here for 186,292 years? That seemed excessive. <nl> ""Excuse me, is there someone I can speak to?"" The clerk hardly looked up from his desk. I asked again and the tips of his wings twitched. I had annoyed him. ""There must be some mistake,"" I continued. <nl> This last statement had gotten his attention, he now stood tall in front of me, and for the first time I got to appreciate the true spectacle that is an ""Afterlife Senior Administrator."" Standing nearly 10 feet tall, as wide as my dad's oak desk, with expansive wings whose tips reached down to his heels. He peered through comically small spectacles at me, his eyes almost bulging out in disbelief. Or was it mere annoyance? <nl> He opened his mouth and a roar upended the stillness around me. ""We make no mistakes. I've been doing this for as long as your kind has existed, i have never once seen a mistake, let alone made one."" He huffed and puffed as I carefully considered my next words. <nl> ""Of course, I understand. But is it possible?"" The words seemed not to anger him further, but neither did they calm him. He strode over to the file cabinet while mumbling something about how humans always amaze him with their self-centeredness. <nl>He huffed and puffed as I carefully considered my next words. <nl> ""I'm sorry, I don't understand. Can you explain it again?"" He seemed surprised by my question, but obliged nonetheless. <nl># ""If you can just fix this little issue, I won't complain to anyone."" Maybe threatening to bring in his supervisor would make this easy. <nl><nl> ""No!"" he said, as he pulled out a folder. Here you will find a description of your life, followed by the relevant info. The first section describes your characteristics, aptitudes, estimates, etc. The second describes and lists your good deeds, as well as the weight they carried. The third section does the same, for the bad deeds.

You didn't hear about it, did you? <nl> But like all mastered skills, I got bored with my gift for theft. It had become too easy.

To be honest, it's the only thing I bother stealing anymore. I have a lock of Marilyn Monroe's hair and a lock of Mitch Hedberg's hair. I have a scrap of Dean Martin's tuxedo, and Mr. Rogers' tuxedo.

And I succeeded. <nl> I keep Scott Weiland's ashes inside this brass crab that I got from my grandma. The crab's shell flips up and there's Scott, in a baggie with a twisty tie on it. His family has no idea. They have a mixture of crushed seashells. Don't worry, though. I'll give Scott back in a few years. <nl> But for now I want to sit here and listen to Plush again, the acoustic version, which is way more melancholy and captures the spirit of the song way better than the full band version. Very lonely. Just like an invisible person's life. <nl> Just me and the voice who sang the words, waiting for tomorrow. <eos>

"<sos> I entered the study carefully. I don't know why. He had allowed my entry and the house was empty but for myself. I wouldn't be scolded or reprimanded or banished from the premises for entering. It was as nondescript as the rest of the house, at least to somebody like myself so accustomed to the extravagant ways of the rich and eccentric. It was meticulously kept, from the mahogany desk to the spotless hardwood floors. He must have cleaned them himself, unlike the rest of the house where it was my responsibility to tend to the quotidian tasks of watering plants and dusting and mopping. <nl> The walls were adorned with books. I expected that, I think. He was a studious man who prided himself on his knowledge of matters far and wide. He commonly reported the formal Latin name of any species of plant or animal on the grounds, from ants to bees to the raccoons and squirrels. He knew of foreign policy issues on the news that were far beyond my grasp. He read perpetually, always entranced by a new novel or reference book. The plethora of books in the library created a panorama of colors and he kept them neatly sorted by genre and author. That's what I first noticed. The books in the study were all the same. There must have been a thousand of those thick, leather-bound books. <nl> And there was his desk. It was as simple as I would have imagined. In spite of the columns that adorned the facade of the house and the ornate woodwork of the main banister, he was a man of simple tastes. Quality over quantity, he would always say. And the desk was of the utmost quality and kept in the most pristine order. I could almost envision him sitting there, hunched as he scribbled some complex thesis or as he lost himself in the minutiae of some topic. The chair was empty, though. I would never see him in this room. By some mysterious affliction he had seemingly aged two dozen years in his last week and by the end he could barely croak out his final words. He had grown cold and indifferent and had locked himself away in his study until he could no longer physically cope to walk down from the bedroom. And then, as he lay bedridden and surely on his deathbed, he had dismissed the doctors and his children and grandchildren and asked for only me to stay. <nl> ""Enter the study,"" he had told me. My face must have shown my surprise because he nodded to confirm. He had always told me to never enter the study. Never, under any circumstance, was I to enter the study. What he had said next shocked me just as much. ""Destroy it,"" he murmured. I had frowned. Destroy the study? It was, in all its mystery, the keystone of the house. To destroy the study was to destroy the house. And to destroy the house was to destroy his memory and his legacy and everything he had done. And then he shook his head. ""No,"" he gasped and I felt bad for forcing him to repeat himself in his dying moments. ""Destroy *it*."" And then he closed his eyes and he was taken away. The funeral had been a quiet affair. He was never one for fanfare. <nl> I looked past the desk. The study was windowless, situated in the middle of the house, like an engine room whose inner workings I had never  been made privy to. Two walls had the brown books, each seemingly identical to each of its neighbors. Behind me was the door. And against the last wall was a box with a sheet draped over it, as if hiding it had somehow allowed him to forget about its existence. <nl> I am not an educated man. Books were of no interest to me, as much as my master insisted that I read a set number of them a month. I had complained and rolled my eyes but ultimately obliged his every wish. I like to think I am a better man for it. But that aside, the identical books would not be what I first explored. I saw a box and I wanted to know what it contained. And so I made my way to the back wall and, as if I was hoping to surprise whatever the box might contain, I ripped the sheet off with the aplomb of a practiced magician. <nl> Only then did I see that it wasn't a box. It was a cage. And inside was a creature that stared at me unblinkingly. It was disturbingly human-like, or perhaps more like one of the apes I had seen in the pictures of the encyclopedias my master sometimes read, more comfortable on four feet than on two. I innately knew that this was what I was meant to destroy. This was the *it* he was referring to with his last words. And a part of me knew that this was somehow connected to my master's demise. I tore my eyes away from the familiar dark eyes of the creature and towards the books. I was a fool, in spite of years of teachings. That much was certain. The answer was doubtlessly in the books but I, a brute at heart, had insisted on driving straight towards the question instead of first satisfying myself with an answer. <nl> I moved to cover the creature with the sheet again and it finally broke its silence. ""No,"" it hissed and those long, spindly fingers grabbed the bars of the cage. Something within me urged me to obey and I dropped the sheet onto the ground. ""Release me,"" the creature demanded and I nodded wordlessly. The key would be in the desk. <nl> I turned now, released from the void of the eyes. The drawers of the desk were locked. My master had not intended for me to indulge in the secrets of the study. I was to destroy its contents and nothing more. In the center of the desk there was one more book, again identical to the ones on the walls. There was something caught between the pages and I flipped it open. There sat the key and I heard the creature hiss in anticipation. But there was my name, as best as I could tell, and I could not help but start to read. <nl> *My dearest Noah,* it began and I smiled sadly. He always addressed me as such before he began to lecture me, indifferent as to whether I fully comprehended what he said or if I just smiled and nodded. Sometimes I think he just liked to have somebody who listened. *If you are reading this, I am afraid that this side of me that I always tried to hide from you has come to light. I hope that, by the end of the journey on which you have chosen to embark by ignoring my last command, your opinion of me does not change.* <nl> I shuddered. He spoke from the grave as if I was already half buried myself. I had always obeyed him, but this time curiosity had gotten the best of me. I read on, ignoring the clamor behind me. The cage rattled and shook and from the throat of the creature escaped the familiar voice of my master, screaming in a rage I had never witnessed. <nl> *Behind you is a creature that is every bit me, yet not the me that you ever had the privilege of knowing. This is, more than anything else, what I will be remembered by if you do not succeed in destroying it. I know how much you have hated the readings I have given you over the years, but I beg that you please begin from the first volume of this series and do not stop until you understand why I have given you this last command.* I looked around. It was a gargantuan task to read each book in the study, especially at the pace I read. *The first few will provide you the reasons that the younger, bolder and more ambitious me had for exploring this side of our existence.* I paused and wiped a tear from my eye before it plummeted to the page below. I remembered my master's younger years. He had been handsome and daring and ready to take the world by storm. Business ventures flourished and women ogled and fell for him and he quickly amassed a fortune only the extremely capable or fortunately endowed could manage. Age had made him cautious and private but just as curious as ever. The creature had paused its racket and wheezed raspy breaths now. <nl> *The next seven hundred or so will detail the journey I have taken so that you need not make the same journey.* Seven hundred books? I could barely handle the three or four a month that he demanded. Hopefully they were riddled with sketches and empty space but I knew that was not the way of my master. The text would be small and cramped in order to fit the most detail on each page. I read on in a stupor, dwarfed by the size of my task and marveling at the life my master had led in this secret room that was the nucleus of the house. <nl> *Call them trials or call them tortures - it matters naught. I have always told you that my success would be my demise.* He did always say that. I always imagined assassins or hitmen dispatched by jealous heirs, not an other-worldly creature locked in a cage locked in a room. *My success has been my demise, as I'm sure you've already realized.* I had not realized, but now I did. This was what he had sought to achieve; not to parade around the world or display in a museum but for the sake of achievement. This was what had destroyed him, and he thought it sinister enough to demand its destruction, legacy be damned. <nl> *The last few will provide you the reasons that the older, wiser me had for regretting ever beginning this wretched experiment.* <nl> ***** <nl> [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cdx0ss/masters_study_part_2/) <nl> [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/ce1wu9/masters_study_part_3/) <nl> ***** <nl> Thanks for reading!

The answer was doubtlessly in the books but I, a brute at heart, had insisted on driving straight towards the question instead of first satisfying myself with an answer. <nl> I moved to cover the creature with the sheet again and it finally broke its silence. ""No,"" it hissed and those long, spindly fingers grabbed the bars of the cage. Something within me urged me to obey and I dropped the sheet onto the ground. ""Release me,"" the creature demanded and I nodded wordlessly. The key would be in the desk. <nl> I turned now, released from the void of the eyes. The drawers of the desk were locked. My master had not intended for me to indulge in the secrets of the study. I was to destroy its contents and nothing more. In the center of the desk there was one more book, again identical to the ones on the walls. There was something caught between the pages and I flipped it open. There sat the key and I heard the creature hiss in anticipation. But there was my name, as best as I could tell, and I could not help but start to read. <nl> *My dearest Noah,* it began and I smiled sadly. He always addressed me as such before he began to lecture me, indifferent as to whether I fully comprehended what he said or if I just smiled and nodded. Sometimes I think he just liked to have somebody who listened. *If you are reading this, I am afraid that this side of me that I always tried to hide from you has come to light. I hope that, by the end of the journey on which you have chosen to embark by ignoring my last command, your opinion of me does not change.* <nl> I shuddered. He spoke from the grave as if I was already half buried myself. I had always obeyed him, but this time curiosity had gotten the best of me. I read on, ignoring the clamor behind me. The cage rattled and shook and from the throat of the creature escaped the familiar voice of my master, screaming in a rage I had never witnessed. <nl>The creature's voice echoed in my mind, calling out to me to set it free. I could feel its hot breath on the back of my neck, urging me to release it from its prison.<nl><nl> *Behind you is a creature that is every bit me, yet not the me that you ever had the privilege of knowing. This is, more than anything else, what I will be remembered by if you do not succeed in destroying it. I know how much you have hated the readings I have given you over the years, but I beg that you please begin from the first volume of this series and do not stop until you understand why I have given you this last command.* I looked around. It was a gargantuan task to read each book in the study, especially at the pace I read. *The first few will provide you the reasons that the younger, bolder and more ambitious me had for exploring this side of our existence.* I paused and wiped a tear from my eye before it plummeted to the page below. I remembered my master's younger years. He had been handsome and daring and ready to take the world by storm. Business ventures flourished and women ogled and fell for him and he quickly amassed a fortune only the extremely capable or fortunately endowed could manage. Age had made him cautious and private but just as curious as ever. The creature had paused its racket and wheezed raspy breaths now. <nl> *The next seven hundred or so will detail the journey I have taken so that you need not make the same journey.* Seven hundred books? I could barely handle the three or four a month that he demanded. Hopefully they were riddled with sketches and empty space but I knew that was not the way of my master. The text would be small and cramped in order to fit the most detail on each page. I read on in a stupor, dwarfed by the size of my task and marveling at the life my master had led in this secret room that was the nucleus of the house. <nl> *Call them trials or call them tortures - it matters naught. I have always told you that my success would be my demise.* He did always say that. I always imagined assassins or hitmen dispatched by jealous heirs, not an other-worldly creature locked in a cage locked in a room. *My success has been my demise, as I'm sure you've already realized.* I had not realized, but now I did. This was what he had sought to achieve; not to parade around the world or display in a museum but for the sake of achievement. This was what had destroyed him, and he thought it sinister enough to demand its destruction, legacy be damned. <nl> *The last few will provide you the reasons that the older, wiser me had for regretting ever beginning this wretched experiment.* <nl> ***** <nl> [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cdx0ss/masters_study_part_2/) <nl> [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/ce1wu9/masters_study_part_3/) <nl> ***** <nl> Thanks for reading!

"<sos> It's been 10 years since I left David at the altar, surrounded by my scandalised friends and family. David was a sweet man, but I knew in my heart what I wanted, I couldn't ignore it. <nl> I ran down the street to our usual rendezvous, I didn't care that people were staring at me as my veil flew behind me in the wind. I had to see him again, I had to. <nl> But when I arrived, breathless and full of anticipation, he wasn't there. He never showed up, and I was left to pick up the pieces of my life in this small town. It was too late for me and David, he packed up his dignity and left for the city the next week. I don't blame him, I broke every good thing I'd ever had. <nl> Over time, family and friends finally forgave me, and I managed to repair a lot of the relationships I had damaged with my thoughtlessness. I went to counselling, took up swimming and Krav Maga, and tried to better myself. I never entered another relationship after that though. I didn't trust myself or anyone else. I'd been on a few dates here and there, but I figured I was better off on my own. I often wondered what happened that day, what scared him away? Did he ever love me? Had I truly loved anyone? <nl> I was pondering over this as I sipped a glass of wine on my sofa. I'd just got in from work, and my cat was rubbing herself all over my feet, welcoming me home. I reached down for a scratch, then realised I had no food for her in the house. I downed the last of my drink, and headed to the shop on the corner. <nl> I was perusing through the pet food aisle, debating whether to get Whiskas or Purina, when I saw him. He was standing at the end of the aisle, inspecting  the cleaning products. At first, I thought I was dreaming; but no, there he was. He looked the same, still as beautiful as I remembered. I immediately hid at the end of the aisle, but I don't think he'd seen me. My first instinct was to run away, but I had to know. I had to know the reason. So I said a quick prayer, and walked back down the aisle towards him. <nl> ""Joe! Where did you come from? It's been a while."" I said a little too loudly. He finally looked at me, and I saw surprise in his eyes. He didn't reply, he didn't say a word. He just looked at me like a deer caught in the headlights. After an awkward silence, my smile had changed to a sad frown. This guy just breaks my heart and then completely ignores me? I had to know...I had to. <nl> I looked him right in the eyes, though mine were threatening to brim over, ""where did you go?"" <nl> Still no answer. I think this was more insulting than if he'd cussed at me. His eyes were darting around, as if looking for a way out, but I wasn't leaving without an answer, so I repeated it louder, ""Where. Did. You. Go??"" <nl> ""Cotton Eye Joe?"" A familiar voice asked behind me. My stomach dropped and I turned to see David standing there, with a basket of groceries on his arm. His eyes grew wide when he saw me, but then went cold. He looked over me to Joe, ""Come on babe, we're leaving."" He held out his hand, and Joe silently took it. They walked out of the store together, hand in hand. For a brief moment, Joe looked back at me, then just like that, he was gone. I was left alone, again. <nl> I never saw them again, I've moved on since then, but I know if it hadn't been for Cotton Eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. And to this day, I still don't know where he and David went. But after all this time, I wish them happiness. <eos>

"<sos> ""Commander, we've arrived."" Zarathan turned his head slightly towards his subordinate officer, nodding to them. His mandibles clicked with restrained anticipation for what they had planned. He turned to look at the blue and white pearl of a planet before them, narrowing his compound eyes. ""You said they were weakened by a plague, correct?"" He looked back to his subordinate, letting them respond. ""Yes sir. Some three hundred years ago. Half their population died; they will be easy to conquer.""

A drone quickly speared the sheriff in the chest with their plasma lance, watching the color drain from the man's face. A fair amount of the crowd of humans stepped back, seeing the sheriff quickly turn pale. His eyes became bloodshot and glowed, his skin ghostly pale.

I try to get her face as exact as possible, before tossing away the pencil and shoving the paper in my pocket. <nl> *I'll find you, Katrina,* I think to myself. *I'll die before failing you. Meaning i'll likely die soon.* <nl> I laugh to myself quietly, before putting my face to my hands and finally letting out a pained sob. She loved those jokes. Or did she? I can't remember. *God, I can't remember.* I check my phone for her number. <nl> It's still there. Listed as Undyne. I laugh to myself softly. <nl> ""Are you okay?"" I type out. No response. I put my phone back into my pocket. I have to find her. I stop in my tracks. <nl> But wait, who am I supposed to be looking for in the first place? <eos>

"<sos> We really just didn't have anyone to name. My sister was long gone, my husband was an only child, and none of our friends really went to church anymore. Jerry was just being a smartass when he named Loki, God of Mischief, the godfather. The pastor didn't get the joke, and... well that was that. <nl> The first time I remember it was a toy snake in the crib. Helena was grasping it and waving it around, just cackling. She cried when I took it away, and when we reviewed the baby cams it just seemed to appear. <nl> The next time she was about 5. She was playing outside when, through the window, I saw Mrs. Voelz stride across our lawn with a giant bag of something. I stepped outside to say hello but was completely ignored by her. Her eyes had an unnatural, cloudy glaze over them. She gave Helena the bag and retreated back to her house. I found the bag brimming with candy, and when I confronted Mrs. Voelz about it she had no idea what I was talking about. Apparently she had gone to the store, purchased about $50 worth of candy, and given it to my daughter without remembering any of it. Her husband insisted she go see a doctor, but in my heart I knew she hadn't been ill. <nl> After that, strange things always seemed to happen. My car keys would appear on the table only *after* it was too late to drive Helena to piano lessons. A thermometer at school would say she had a high fever on the day of a test, but she was cool to the touch. When she got the lead in the high school play, it was suddenly decided that the football team was given far too much funding and that it should be reallocated to the theater program. That's when I knew I wasn't crazy. <nl> We were folding laundry together that Sunday, just the two of us, when I decided it was time. ""Lena, I was thinking about it, and I'd like to invite your godfather over for dinner Friday night."" <nl> Helena's hands froze. ""My godfather?"" <nl> ""Yes. I think it's time that we all sat down and talked. Would you pass along the invite?"" I asked cooly. <nl> ""Mom, I really don't think that's a good idea,"" she replied. I was amazed and overwhelmed. She wasn't trying to deny it. <nl> ""Well I do. We really need to have better communication with him, and it needs to start now."" <nl> ""But Mom...."" <nl> ""No 'buts',"" I said firmly. ""You are going to pass along the invite, and we are going to have a nice, family dinner. Finish up the laundry. It looks like I need to go shopping."" <nl> I got up and grabbed my purse and keys. She hadn't denied it. She knew what I was talking about. She didn't say he wasn't real. My heart was pounding as I headed towards the door. <nl> My hand was on the door knob when the mail slot opened, and a letter swooped to the floor. But... it was Sunday? I yanked open the door, but there was no one in sight. <nl> My racing heart stopped, and I looked at the letter on the floor. In big, green ink was elegantly scrawled: <nl> *See you Friday* <nl> Edit: People seem to be really interested in this and are asking for a part 2. Someone even gave me gold, so now I feel like I owe you guys. You'll find part 2 below somewhere. Thanks for all the feedback :) <eos>

"<sos> Bump. The neighbors are at it again. Great. I'm just trying to get some sleep. I know it's Friday night. But still. Some of us need their sleep. <nl> Bump. Might as well get up. Desperately need to pee. <nl> I reached for my cell and used the flashlight. Thousands of little eyes on the walls, on the ceiling, on the bed... were looking back at me. Suddenly I was very much awake. I turned on my bedside lamp. Spiders. There were more than the ones I normally saw in the appartment. I did recognize Maxie, the jumping spider from the bathroom. With a series of quick little jumps, he approached me. I was too terrified to move. He jumped on the screen of my smartphone. What seemed to be a chaotic display of jumping prowess actually opened a notepad. A notepad with as message. ""Hello Jonathan."" <nl> Maxie was looking at me with his largest eyes. ""Um... Hello?"" <nl> He darted over the screen, typing letter per letter with his body. ""We as your roommates want to show our appreciation."" <nl> ""Appreciation? For what?"" <nl> ""For feeding us. Instead of killing us on sight. Or chucking us out in the freezing winter. You could have done that, but you didn't. You gave us names and made sure our abdomens were filled. It allowed us to thrive. Even the males survived. The males that are normally eaten by the females during courtship. All thanks to you."" <nl> Feeding them. The bugs. The bugs that I had zapped with the electric fly swatter. The ones I had tossed into the webs. <nl> ""We know you are sad."" <nl> ""Sad? No no no, I'm not sad. I am a bit scared now. I did not know there were so many of you guys."" <nl> ""You are right. These are not only the spiders of your apartment. These are all the spiders from the entire building. They are helping."" <nl> ""Helping? With what?"" <nl> ""A surprise."" <nl> Now I was really unnerved. What possible surprise could spiders present a human? <nl> ""You see Jonathan, you are much like us: a lurker."" <nl> ""A lurker? You mean like a creep?"" <nl> ""No. We lurk in webs or on walls. We stalk our prey. You lurk too. But you admire your prey."" <nl> ""What prey? If you are so smart you can operate my phone, you should now I just get my food from the supermarket. Or that I order some take away if I'm really lazy."" <nl> ""Yes, we know. But that is not the prey I am referring too. Let me show you."" <nl> With some skittering and bouncing Maxie had successfully opened my Facebook. And navigated to the contact that I admired from a distance: Dina. The one girl that I had a connection with. Until her parents had decided to move. This was way before Facebook existed. Now I no longer had the guts to talk to her. Her profile was pretty public. Yes, I lurked. <nl> Maxie opened the notepad again. ""We have tracked her. And lured her."" <nl> The sea of hairy legs and bodies opened. Bump. A giant cocoon was dragged into my bedroom. <nl> ""She is sedated by some of us. Nothing permanent. She will be like this for a few more hours. You could mate with here without the risk of being eaten."" <nl> ""What... NO! Are you nuts?"" <nl> He did not blink, but Maxie looked confused. Never thought a spider could look confused. ""We were not sure. Could not reach consensus. We have a plan B."" <nl> ""More surprises?"" <nl> ""Yes. To woo a mate, we sometimes offer food. We have gathered a gourmet breakfast for the both of you in your kitchen."" <nl> I was gasping for air. This was not happening. <nl> ""Rest assured Jonathan, it is human food. Don't be afraid."" <nl> Don't be afraid. Don't be fucking afraid?! Dina, in my house, passed out... How would that make me look? I was going to go to jail for this. <nl> ""It's OK Jonathan, she went to a bar, she waited for a date that never arrived. And conveniently passed out in an alley. No one saw us, we transported her through the sewers. You could tell her you found her at the bar, recognized her, and brought her here to recover. Don't worry, look, we are removing the webbing. There will be no trace of us."" <nl> The armada of spiders gently put her in the bed and was eating the cocoon. In a matter of minutes, Dina lay in Jonathan's bed. Like a sleeping beauty. <nl> I might have a real shot at this. ""Okay. Your plan might work. I'll go sleep on the couch, and we'll see what happens in the morning."" <nl> Maxie jumped exited up and down the screen, producing a lot of gibberish on the notepad. The spiders moved off, and I moved out of the bedroom. <nl> I made myself comfortable on the couch after a quick toilet break. One last look at the screen. Maxie was still there. ""Sleep tight Jonathan. I will go back to my spot in the bathroom. O, before I forget. Don't worry about your neighbors. The widows took care of them. They won't be bothering you anymore."" <nl> *Edit: Spelling* <eos>

"<sos> Benny kept a calendar. It was old, of course, a 2021 edition with 12 months of Shar-peis in flowerpots for some reason. Every January 1st, Benny would remark the dates, all of them, all 365. His wrist would creak at the end of it and his head would throb, but it was important work. It's how he never lost track of time, even there, in the dark, and the quiet, and the cold. <nl> Where were they, exactly? Benny often wondered. He'd only been a little boy when the sirens had started wailing and they'd trundled off into the depths of steel below their house. <nl> ""Chicago Heights, sweetie,"" his mother would tell him. ""The heart of America."" <nl> That sounded right, of course, but it had been so long. So long down in the dark and the quiet and the cold. It was hard to even remember what Chicago Heights *looked* like. <nl> ""Best not to try and remember,"" his father would tell him. ""It won't look like that when we come out."" <nl> ""And when'll that be?"" Benny asked. Over and over, he asked. <nl> His mother would shake her head and say nothing. His father would grit his teeth and mutter nonsense. Rose would nod and say, ""I wonder that, too,"" like it was an especially clever and admirable thing for an older brother to wonder. <nl> *December 24* <nl> ""Christmas eve,"" Benny said, looking hopefully at his mother, who refused to meet his eyes. ""You think Santa'll come this year? Huh, Dad?"" <nl> His father was bent over a book. He pretended not to hear. <nl> Rose perked up at the sound of her brother's voice. ""Santa? Tell me again about Santa."" <nl> Benny crept to the side of Rose's bed. Every step echoed in the shelter. The sound rang in his ears. ""He's very magical,"" said Benny. ""He lives at the North Pole, up in the cold, and he makes toys for boys and girls."" <nl> ""All boys and girls?"" <nl> ""*Good* boys and girls,"" said Benny knowingly. <nl> ""How does he know which is which?"" said Rose. <nl> ""He can see it all,"" said Benny, holding his hands up to his eyes. ""When you're sleeping and when you're awake and when you're good and when you're bad. He sees it *all*."" <nl> ""He's seen us this whole time?"" said Rose, wondering and afraid. <nl> ""Yup,"" said Benny. ""He knows everything that's happened."" <nl> ""Do you think I've been good?"" <nl> Benny put a hand to his sister's forehead. She was sweating again. He wiped his hand off on the bedspread. ""Of course! He knows what a good daughter and sister you've been."" <nl> ""And do you think..."" Rose shook her head. ""That's dumb..."" <nl> ""Do I think he'll come this year?"" Benny smiled, leaning back to glance at his father, still pretending to read his book. ""I just bet. I just bet. But you have to sleep. He won't come if you don't sleep."" <nl> Rose nodded, feigning a yawn. ""I was tired anyway."" <nl> Benny stood up. ""When morning comes, you'll see."" <nl> ""And you'll tell me when it's morning?"" <nl> ""I always do."" <nl> Then Benny went back to his favorite chair and sat. He was nearly 20 years old by his calculations. His body never stopped feeling big and strange and foreign. He hated it sometimes. He wanted his old body back. When he was smaller, the shelter seemed so big and spacious. Now he just felt cramped all the time. <nl> Still, the shelter was big enough to hide the occasional secret. He'd just have to look hard to find a present for Rose. He'd made a promise, after all. <nl> But just as Benny had begun setting about in search of a present to give, there was a strange sound from high above. A tapping sound and then a wrenching sound. A grinding sound. A heavy breathing sound. <nl> Benny looked to his father and saw that the old man wasn't afraid, so he wouldn't be afraid either. <nl> Then the ladder was rattling and boots were scuffling on the rusting iron. <nl> ""It's so dark down here!"" came a deep, joyful voice. White light, laced with just the barest trace of pink, filtered down the tunnel and into the shelter. The man reached the floor. <nl> ""I knew it,"" said the man. Benny could hardly see him in the glare of the light. ""Survivors. Believers. I'm not too late. Merry Christmas child."" <nl> ""Santa?"" said Benny. <nl> The man placed the light on the ground, shining the beam straight up, just barely illuminating the chamber. The man wore a heavy, red coat and black, shiny boots. His beard was gray and scraggly. <nl> ""I nearly lost you down here, Benny,"" said Santa. ""It's been so hard these years, in all this fallout. Finding children. Finding families. Bringing hope. I'm sorry it's taken me so long."" <nl> ""It's fine, Santa,"" said Benny. ""I'm so glad you're here. We're all so glad you're here. Right Dad?"" <nl> Santa's eyes moved to the corner of the room, where a decomposing male body was wrapped around a soggy, bile-soaked hardcover book. <nl> ""Right Mom?"" <nl> Across from the male corpse, a skin-dappled skeleton lay in repose on a rotten bunk bed. <nl> ""We have to be quiet,"" said Benny. ""Rose is asleep."" <nl> Santa nodded, swallowing. Adjusting the grip on his threadbare and nearly empty sack, he approached the bunk on the furthest edge of the room. The girl there was alive. She smiled in her sleep, even as cold perspiration rolled across her waxy features. Her legs were gone. Her left hand as well. The wounds were crudely washed and covered, festering under a thin blanket. <nl> ""She's been so good,"" said Benny. ""She really is such a good girl. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her. I just hope you know that, and I hope you can give her a good Christmas."" <nl> Santa nodded. ""Yes, of course."" He reached into his sack. ""I always bring gifts for good boys and good girls. In truth, Benny...I bring gifts for everyone...not just the good ones."" <nl> Benny smiled. <nl> The pistol Santa pulled from his sack had a silencer, because most of those still alive had become violently sensitive to sound. His gift was mercy, after all. <nl> At the top of ladder, Santa resealed the hatch and covered the entrance with fresh sod. It was a warm December 25th. The night sky was greenish blue and smelled of mustard and burnt plastic. <nl> He had so many more homes to visit before morning came. <eos>

He sees it *all*."" <nl> ""He's seen us this whole time?"" said Rose, wondering and afraid. <nl> ""Yup,"" said Benny. ""He knows everything that's happened."" <nl> ""Do you think I've been good?"" <nl> Benny put a hand to his sister's forehead. She was sweating again. He wiped his hand off on the bedspread. ""Of course! He knows what a good daughter and sister you've been."" <nl> ""And do you think..."" Rose shook her head. ""That's dumb..."" <nl> ""Do I think he'll come this year?"" Benny smiled, leaning back to glance at his father, still pretending to read his book. ""I just bet. I just bet. But you have to sleep. He won't come if you don't sleep."" <nl> Rose nodded, feigning a yawn. ""I was tired anyway."" <nl> Benny stood up. ""When morning comes, you'll see."" <nl> ""And you'll tell me when it's morning?"" <nl> ""I always do."" <nl> Then Benny went back to his favorite chair and sat. He was nearly 20 years old by his calculations. His body never stopped feeling big and strange and foreign. He hated it sometimes. He wanted his old body back. When he was smaller, the shelter seemed so big and spacious. Now he just felt cramped all the time. <nl> Still, the shelter was big enough to hide the occasional secret. He'd just have to look hard to find a present for Rose. He'd made a promise, after all. <nl> But just as Benny had begun setting about in search of a present to give, there was a strange sound from high above. A tapping sound and then a wrenching sound. A grinding sound. A heavy breathing sound. <nl> Benny looked to his father and saw that the old man wasn't afraid, so he wouldn't be afraid either. <nl> Then the ladder was rattling and boots were scuffling on the rusting iron. <nl> ""It's so dark down here!"" came a deep, joyful voice. White light, laced with just the barest trace of pink, filtered down the tunnel and into the shelter. The man reached the floor. <nl> ""I knew it,"" said the man. Benny could hardly see him in the glare of the light. ""Survivors. Believers. I'm not too late. Merry Christmas child."" <nl> ""Santa?"" said Benny. <nl> The man placed the light on the ground, shining the beam straight up, just barely illuminating the chamber. The man wore a heavy, red coat and black, shiny boots. His beard was gray and scraggly. <nl>I nearly lost you down here, Benny,"" said Santa. ""It's been so hard these years, in all this fallout. Finding children. Finding families. Bringing hope. I'm sorry it's taken me so long.<nl><nl> ""I nearly lost you down here, Benny,"" said Santa. ""It's been so hard these years, in all this fallout. Finding children. Finding families. Bringing hope. I'm sorry it's taken me so long."" <nl> ""It's fine, Santa,"" said Benny. ""I'm so glad you're here. We're all so glad you're here. Right Dad?"" <nl> Santa's eyes moved to the corner of the room, where a decomposing male body was wrapped around a soggy, bile-soaked hardcover book. <nl> ""Right Mom?"" <nl> Across from the male corpse, a skin-dappled skeleton lay in repose on a rotten bunk bed. <nl> ""We have to be quiet,"" said Benny. ""Rose is asleep."" <nl> Santa nodded, swallowing. Adjusting the grip on his threadbare and nearly empty sack, he approached the bunk on the furthest edge of the room. The girl there was alive. She smiled in her sleep, even as cold perspiration rolled across her waxy features. Her legs were gone. Her left hand as well. The wounds were crudely washed and covered, festering under a thin blanket. <nl> ""She's been so good,"" said Benny. ""She really is such a good girl. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her. I just hope you know that, and I hope you can give her a good Christmas."" <nl> Santa nodded. ""Yes, of course."" He reached into his sack. ""I always bring gifts for good boys and good girls. In truth, Benny...I bring gifts for everyone...not just the good ones."" <nl> Benny smiled. <nl> The pistol Santa pulled from his sack had a silencer, because most of those still alive had become violently sensitive to sound. His gift was mercy, after all. <nl> At the top of ladder, Santa resealed the hatch and covered the entrance with fresh sod. It was a warm December 25th. The night sky was greenish blue and smelled of mustard and burnt plastic. <nl> He had so many more homes to visit before morning came. <eos>

"<sos> I'm an executioner, for lack of a better word. To most people, it brings up thoughts of the guillotine or a hangman's noose. Maybe your mind wanders more to decapitations or electric chairs or firing squads. That type of thing. That's what I would do for you, as an average citizen. A bullet to an artery is a cheap solution. The wrong combination of fatal injections like they used to do back in the twenty-first century is another decent option. You'll last a few minutes, maybe. It'll get you a pretty average spot in the afterlife. People of all ages and shapes and sizes come to me. Some of them pay out the ass for my services, it's crazy. A three-hundred pound dude who can't be more than a few months away from a fatal heart attack as he chows down on a two-pound burger paying me a few thousand dollars to shoot him in an artery so he can go while he snacks? I mean, sure, I'll do it... Business is business and you don't say no to good business. <nl> The rich have it right, I'll tell you that much. They pay me to kill them in ways so excruciatingly slowly that sometimes I almost forget to do as I've been asked. Bacon gives you cancer? There is one elderly lady who had me wallpaper her house in bacon and cook it for her every morning as she smiles and breathes in those supposedly toxic fumes, just to maximize her chance of cancer. Bananas and radiation? You've heard of bubble baths - how about banana baths? I had never seen so many bananas in my life. Everybody is in such a hurry it seems like, trying to make themselves die as slowly as possible so that they can enter the afterlife in an elevated status, that none of them really start to think. You see, sometimes it's not about what you do to ensure your demise. It's about what you do to ward it off and prolong the inevitable. I don't believe in reincarnation or any of that, but when this thought occurred to me, I swear it must have been some long-dead guru whispering in my ear. Forget the nooses. Forget the guns. Forget the poison or the electric chair or getting run over by a truck so that you slowly die from internal bleeding. It's all unnecessary. Really, the only reason I keep doing it is because I love helping out. It's all about self-acceptance, and I accepted my fate long ago. <nl> In a way, it's an industry secret. If I were to tell people the truth, I'd be broke. I wouldn't be able to afford this extravagant lifestyle and this fantastic healthcare. Most jobs cut benefits so long ago that I'm one of a rare handful actively seeking to prolong my life. All part of my realization. It's not about what you do to end your life. It's about what you do to have it not end. We're never actually any more alive than the moment we're born. From that minute on, we are all slowly dying. So my approach is to prolong my life as long as humanly possible. I'll be dying for as long as possible and enter the afterlife in unprecedented status. And you know what they say about longevity? Happy people live longer. A glass of red wine with dinner helps. Eat the placenta. Shit like that. So here I am.

"<sos> ""What you're talking about, General, is genocide."" Said the Minister for Culture and Humanities. <nl> ""What I'm talking about is self preservation. From the limited contacts we have had with them we know that they are a species not beyond war, with technologies far superior to our own. We are talking about a species we are unfamiliar with who could wipe us out in an instant. The only advantage we currently have is the element of surprise, an advantage you would have us waste on a suicidal goodwill mission into hostile territory!"" Said the General slamming his fist on the table. <nl> ""I would remind you, General, that our own society is not past war, violence, and, as you have clearly demonstrated, xenophobia. So I apologize that I would rather try to make peace and share ideas, rather than blindly swing at a hornets nest. Tell me General, if they are as advanced as you describe them wouldn't a preemptive strike be nothing but a futile, vainglorious slap in the face to them? You're arguing a cavalry charge against a tank formation!"" <nl> ""Gentlemen, please. We can come to some sort of agreement."" Said the prime minister adjusting his glasses. ""While I do not believe violence should be our first course of action,"" he said eyeing the general, ""we would be remiss to rule out preparations for a... defensive action."" He finished, looking toward the Minister for Humanities and Culture. ""Now please,"" he continued, ""what do we know about these aliens?"" <nl> The table exploded with every minister vying for attention. The table was silenced by a raise of the prime minister's hand. ""One at a time, in order please."" <nl> The Minister for Humanities and Culture spoke up. ""We know culturally they are similar to us at least in their emotional expression through the arts. I've browsed the, eh, artifact and have to say that most of the data we've recovered could have been from our planet. The basic themes, literature forms, and to a certain extent rhyme structures are identical to ours. They could be our brothers based on this."" <nl> The Minister for Resources cleared his throat. ""Speaking on a mineral reserve basis, their planet could provide supplies for our home world as well as some of the colonies. Their planet seems to have vast resources of not only potable water, but also a highly combustible liquid energy source. It seems that while relatively scarce due to their vast population, it could power our system for about one thousand years if used sparingly."" <nl> The rest of the ministers gave accounts of the aliens and what could be gained from a trade partnership, technological sharing, cultural exchanges and even formation of a galactic exploratory force. The general sat with folded arms, huffing and mumbling through the discussion. When all ministers had spoken he once again sat up. <nl> ""It is my firm belief that the whenever two self contained cultures, no matter how similar meet each other on unequal terms, one will become the victor and the other the conquered. It is a theme we see time and time again throughout history. Normally, the more advanced culture makes contact first and quickly enslaves or eradicates the natives. To our benefit, we gained knowledge of their existence before they discovered us. Unfortunately, we are uneducated savaged to them. At best we could hope for amalgamation into their society. Which is to assume that they would even take the time to contact us before destroying us, an assumption I am not comfortable making. Aside from this 'artifact' we've found, every other indication is that this alien species is violent and prone to war. Every broadcast, no matter how jumbled, contains reference to war, violence, famine. Surely such an advanced civilization would not have to continue such tendencies after the advent of the technological wonders they have. This leads me to believe that this alien civilization views war as sport, something to be done for glory or pleasure. They train their children for war, show them images of war, make game of war. We have seen this through propaganda broadcasts we have picked up, which to this day cause me to lose sleep. We can wait, Sir, but if we do I doubt we'll be able to discuss this again."" <nl> The prime minister sighed and turned away. He looked out the window at his homeworld, the only world he knew. The only world anyone had known before that damned artifact. ""I too have heard the broadcasts General. They are.....disturbing to say the least. Do you truly believe their is no other option aside from an aggressive one?"" <nl> ""Yes Sir."" The General answered. ""I would rather die with a gun in my hand than live with one to my head."" <nl> The prime minister turned and addressed the table. ""General. You have my permission to pursue the military option. Every scrap of information we have been able to piece together points to it as our best option for survival. If we know anything it is this: they would do the same to us."" <eos>

"<sos> A knurled, ancient oak table sat in the center of a solid white room with no windows or doors; it was a little box of nowhere that the Seven Deadly Sins used to discuss important issues in times of dire need. The last time they gathered was to discuss whether or not Barack Obama was *actually* the Anti-Christ or not, because Envy was pretty paranoid that the big guys were making moves a little early. Thankfully, it turned out that he was just black. Fucking stupid humans and their false alarms. <nl> The most recent time, however, the meeting had been called by. . . well, everyone--except for Pride. The other six had contacted her, saying a discussion needed to take place, and Pride warily accepted. She'd done well not to interfere with more than a hundred human lives that year, and had been regularly watching YouTube videos on how to live a humble life. Admittedly, she thought she was better than the guy giving the lectures and quit watching, but it's the thought that counts. <nl> Gluttony, Lust, Wrath, Envy and Greed sat at the table, hands folded, quiet eyes avoiding Pride, whose gaze danced around the room, looking for someone to give her an indication of what was going on. She was feeling an itch of anxiety in the back of her mind, the seed of worry sprouting; had they finally decided to try and take her out? After all, she was *clearly* the strongest and most important Sin. Obviously. <nl> ""So,"" Pride said, clearing her throat, tapping the table. ""Can we just get started already? Seriously, I get the whole 'all or nothing' rule, but she's taking even longer than usual, and it's not like he has anything to offer in these meetings."" <nl> ""**Shut the fuck up**,"" a deep, dark voice, like the crack of ash-colored thunderstorm clouds, crashed over them. ""**I hate you, Pride, you maggot. But I also agree we should stop waiting for that goddamn, slow-as-fuck sack of shit. I don't have any fucking patience left for this. Let's just kill the bitch.**"" <nl> Pride sighed, wagging a finger. ""Now, now, Wrath. Let's remember our table manners. Besides, I wouldn't want you to get hurt fighting the strongest Sin just because you're blind."" <nl> ""**Fuck you and your entire family. I'm going to rip your skull out and fuck it right here, on the table.**"" <nl> Lust perked up, a smile slithering across his face, and Pride groaned. ""God, Lust, have some self-respect. And Wrath--I *am* your family, you idiot. Why are all of the Sins so stupid? Honestly."" <nl> ""Calm down, Wrath,"" Greed said, his voice like two pennies rubbing together. ""Save it for when we make a decision, then you can murder her and whatever else you two freaks have planned. I don't care, but we're going to make sure we get what she has first."" <nl> Pride rolled her eyes. ""Look, guys, I know I'm the greatest of the sins, but you can't take that from me. Even if you pool together and kill me, you'll still all be every bit as inferior as you are now."" <nl> Envy smashed her hands on the table, standing up. ""Quit lying, you bitch! We know you've been working behind our backs, interfering with the human world! We want what you have!"" <nl> Pride knitted her brows. ""Wait, what? What are you talking about?"" <nl> ""Don't play stupid,"" Greed said. ""We know they're throwing a celebration for you right now. It's literally called the 'Pride Parade', and they all get real dressed up in bright colors, making themselves the center of attention, which is your favorite thing in the world to do. So don't even try and pretend this isn't your work. We want a cut of what's going on here. How are you so involved without completely spiraling the world's balance off and. . . you know, pissing Dad off?"" <nl> ""I literally have no idea what you're talking about. But, honestly, this just proves my point. I haven't done any interference, and I didn't do anything to set that up. They just know I'm the best and they're celebrating me, what can I say? Get good, you fucking losers."" <nl> A portal of light fizzled and popped, and a ragged woman fell from it, splatting against the floor like a sack of potatoes. <nl> ""Ah, how great of you to finally join us,"" Greed said. ""Now, be a dear and make it to the table before we adjourn, if you can."" <nl> ""**You dumb bitch. You're ten feet away from us. Just get the fuck up and sit at the fucking table you useless god-turd. Mom must've shit you out on accident.**"" <nl> Sloth yawned, her hand moving at a snail's pace, and the group sighed. <nl> Gluttony finally looked up from his meal, face covered in bits of food and gruel, looking like the disgusting animal he was. ""I want a parade with FOOD, FOOD, SO MUCH FOOD, EVERYBODY EAT AND NEVER STOP EATING AND--"" <nl> ""**You fat piece of shit, don't get started with that or I'm going to drown you in your fucking cereal.**"" <nl> The giant went back to his food, nearly drowning himself in it instead, and pride groaned. She'd always found Gluttony to be repulsive. <nl> ""Just tell us, you bitch,"" Envy said, crying, arms crossed. ""Just fucking tell us! It's not hard! Stop being a meanie, I WANT IT!"" <nl> Pride rubbed her temples--family gatherings are always such a fucking mess. ""Seriously, guys, I didn't do this myself. If they want to celebrate me because I'm awesome, I can't control it. Stop blaming me and blame yourselves for not being worth it."" <nl> ""**I'll fucking paint these walls with you if you don't quit flapping that mouth, and then we'll see who's the best Sin.**"" <nl> Greed opened a little viewport in the center of the table for everyone to look into. As they peered in, they watched the crowd of bright colors and rainbow flags, of men and women defying the norm their father had set in order to do whatever their hearts desired. Men embracing men, women kissing other women, all wearing smiles and standing tall in front of the rest of the world. <nl> ""You guys think this is a parade *I* set up?"" Pride asked, face contorting. <nl> ""**Why are the boys kissing? Oh. . . oh no. I don't want it anymore.**"" <nl> Lust giggled, leaning over to him, and he fled from a hand wandering his way. ""What's the matter, you big, scary man? All that talk and a little fun sends you running? Look at them. . . yes, I need this. I want to be there. Take me there right now, Pride."" <nl> But Pride was confused, staring into the viewport. It was clearly not about her, because if anything, it had the look and feel of something Lust would create for fun. She kept watching them, standing tall before the scorning eyes, disobeying the rules humans before them had tried to set, letting their true selves show without an ounce of shame for it. They were strong, and true, and. . . <nl> Proud. <nl> She smiled as she looked into the porthole--ignoring Wrath's screams, Sloth's yawning corpse inching closer, and Lust starting to make some uncomfortable motions with his hands--and felt pride, just once, for something other than herself. <nl> --- <nl> */r/resonatingfury* <eos>

"<sos> He sat cross-legged, as always, motionless.  His eyes were closed.  It wasn't as though there were anything to see.  It would be the same sight as ever - a row of tight-packed adamantium rods, and the narrow door he had been thrust through all those years ago.  Beyond that, all that was visible from his dismal cage was plain, bare concrete. <nl> His legs were stiff again.  It was time to switch.  Obligingly, he rose, walking a brief lap around the pen.  His eyes never opened.  He didn't need them to.  The cage was large enough to allow him to walk, but no more than five of his great strides long and wide. <nl> His lap completed, he returned to the cold ground.  Laying, this time. <nl> This was the same routine as always.  Sit.  Stew on his thoughts.  Walk a lap.  Lay down.  Stew on his thoughts.  Walk a lap.  Stand.  Stew on his thoughts.  Then back to sitting. <nl> A thousand years, they had said.  As *punishment*.  It had been a joke.  Those pathetic excuses for arbiters, thinking to imprison an Eternal such as himself?  They wouldn't live for even a hundred years - what right did they have to pass judgement on *him*? <nl> He *had* killed most of the people in that city.  They weren't *wrong*.  And, yes, he may have feasted on their flesh.  But he left their bones in the ceremonial arrangement as an offering to their souls.  It was all according to *custom*.  Was that so horrible? <nl> They had clearly thought so.  He'd been amused, at first, at their insolence.  And then surprised, when they'd managed to trap him in a dead-end road.  And then shocked, as they systematically stripped him of one enchantment after another. <nl> He'd been dumbfounded by the time they carted him to the dungeon they'd rigged for the worst offenders of the extramortal world, chained so tightly to the floor of the truck that he couldn't move. <nl> Now, he was just hungry. <nl> At first, they'd shown him at least a *little* bit of compassion.  They'd kept him fed.  Occasionally the guard who brought him food would pass him a bit of news, the goings-on of the above world. <nl> But that had dwindled, little by little.  The food came less often, and the guards stopped visiting. <nl> And then one day, they'd stopped coming entirely.  No matter how loudly he yelled or pounded his feet or slammed into the bars, no one answered. <nl> He was alone. <nl> The lights had gone out soon after.  Of course, a night-haunt such as him had naturally superb night vision.  The darkness was as comfortable as the light.  But he knew.  He knew no one was going to come back.  They had decided to bury him at last.  It wasn't as though he had anyone who would come looking. <nl> Time blurred into an intolerable, endless wall of crippling hunger and weakness.  He wished for an end that he knew was never going to come.  He couldn't die.  Not that he didn't *want* to, he simply wasn't capable of it. <nl> And so he resigned himself to it.  He mulled his plight over in his head, one more time.  And then he rose, walking another lap around the cage. <nl> Something went *plink* in the darkness. <nl> He froze.  His ears twitched.  It was a tiny noise, one easily-overlooked.  But in a world that hadn't known a noise beyond the padding of his feet in what must surely have been centuries, it rang out as loud as a bell. <nl> In the dim greyness of the dark cell, he could see dust spiraling down from the wall opposite his door. <nl> The portal.  He remembered it well.  Once upon a time, it was his signal that he was about to get food and a story.  It hadn't moved in an eternity. <nl> He could hear someone on the far side of it now.  They were pushing.  Swearing. <nl> The sudden burst of light coming through the crack was enough to send his eyes into screaming complaint.  He threw his arms over his face, cowering from the unbearable brightness. <nl> ""About fucking time.""  He heard a low voice mutter.  ""I swear to the five that if I've hurt my shoulder, Paro, I'm going to send *you* the bill.""  The sour words rang out painfully loudly.  He cracked one eye.  The light was still too bright. <nl> ""Oh, stop whining.  You're *fine*.""  A cheerful voice followed the first.  ""You've got to get into the adventure, you know?"" <nl> ""I don't know.  I *don't*.  Not if it means- What are you doing?  What's *that*?"" <nl> Footsteps danced across the ground.  A searing light blazed down at him, much closer. <nl> ""It's a *person*, Alton."" <nl> He laughed.  It was the first time he'd used his voice in forever.  The sound bubbled up from his belly.  He could see them, now.  Two young men, both dressed in oddly fashioned jackets.  The style...wasn't familiar.  He wrinkled his nose.  One of them held a ball of mage-light. <nl> ""A person, eh?""  He rumbled.  Slowly he rose and stretched his limbs.  He stood easily a head higher than either of them. <nl> ""Well- not a person, then.""  The holding the light said.  It was the cheerful one - Paro?  ""What're you doing down *here*?  This doesn't seem like a place you should be, you know."" <nl> ""Shut the fuck up, Paro.""  His friend hissed.  His eyes were wider.  He was looking at the bars of the cage, not the inhabitant.  ""This is Old World stuff.  A jail.  We should *go*."" <nl> ""Old world.""  He repeated, his voice long and drawn out.  ""I take it by your appearance you're not the new shift?""  He smiled mirthlessly.  ""You're tardy.  I'm famished.""  One hand clenched the bars.  They smelled *good*.  So very good. <nl> ""Paro, *now.*""  Alton said.  His voice was overloud and afraid.  He was already backing up, backing away from me.  The concrete barrier was open behind him.  The night-haunt could *see* the faintly lighter room behind him.  Somewhere, somewhere close, there was light again.  Natural light. <nl> ""He's not *going* anywhere, Alton.""  Paro chuckled.  He was completely at ease, inspecting the caged night-haunt.  He wasn't much to look at.  Once, he'd been finely bedecked in the best synth-armor money could buy.  Then, they'd reduced him to a simple jumpsuit.  The years had reduced *that* to some mere rags.  Anything resembling decency had long ago been lost. <nl> The young man stepped closer, grinning. <nl> ""So what'd they have you in for?  And what *are* you?  Never seen anything like you in the bestiary."" <nl> He frowned down at the impertient man.  ""*Bestiary?*  You think to label us as mere animals?  Men have been picked clean straight down to the bones for a fraction of that insult, you fool.""  He sniffed.  ""If you *must* ask, I suppose I can enlighten you.  I'm a night-haunt.  An Eternal, not a *human*.  An extramortal.""  He raised one eyebrow at the men. <nl> ""An answer for an answer.  Who are you?  Is my sentence complete?""  He wanted it to be over.  So very badly.  He *needed* the sensation of hot blood in his mouth again, of tearing through flesh. <nl> They looked between each other.  And then they looked back at him. <nl> ""Uh.  Sentence?""  Paro said, scratching his head.  ""Sorry, big guy, but we're just scavengers.  Been through these ruins a dozen times, but we only just got that door there uncovered last month.""  He grinned.  ""Just *knew* there had to be something good in there."" <nl> He shook his head impatiently. <nl> ""Ruins?  What are you *talking* about.  The human's prison?  Don't be foolish.""  His fingers flexed on the bars.  ""Where are the arbiters?  Why has no one come?  Surely my sentence is complete."" <nl> ""Just...what's going on?""  Alton mumbled, his eyes flicking to his friend.  Paro shook his head. <nl> ""Uh- Well, you see.  This isn't a prison.  It's abandonded.  Has been since the Uprising.""  His words trailed off awkwardly.  The night-haunt shook his head. <nl> ""Uprising?""  He grated.  ""What is *that*?  This is nonsense.  I want to leave.  Let me out."" <nl> ""No.  *No*.  Paro, we're *leaving*.""  Alton said, his eyes narrow and angry.  He grabbed his friend's arm.  Paro didn't move. <nl> ""Sure.  I'll let you out.  But....a few questions, first.""  He cocked his head to the side.  ""I've *heard* of night-haunts before.  Old book I found once.  Haven't been seen in millenia.""  He grinned.  ""Says they're demons.  Are you a demon?"" <nl> The night-haunt bared his teeth at the young man, who didn't even flinch. <nl> ""You insulting piece of filth.  I told you.  I'm an *Eternal*.""  He sighed, and finished begrudgingly.  ""But.  Yes.  Some among the pathetic human masses referred to us as demons."" <nl> ""Splendid.""  Paro said, clapping his hands.  ""Then, I have a proposal for you."" <nl> ""Paro!  Stop.""  Alton ran back, still pulling on his friend's arm.  ""This is *stupid*.  You're playing with fire.  Let's go.  Now."" <nl> Paro shook him off, still watching the night-haunt. <nl> ""Hush.  We'll never get this chance again!  I can't pass it up.  Just picture the look on old Galen's face.  We'd be unstoppable."" <nl> He grinned, revealing two rows of perfect, shining white teeth.  It wasn't a pleasant expression. <nl> ""Become my familiar.  Take the blood oath, swear yourself to me.  Become my servant, now and forever, and I'll let you out."" <nl> (/r/Inorai, critiques always welcome!) <eos>

He wasn't much to look at.  Once, he'd been finely bedecked in the best synth-armor money could buy.  Then, they'd reduced him to a simple jumpsuit.  The years had reduced *that* to some mere rags.  Anything resembling decency had long ago been lost. <nl> The young man stepped closer, grinning. <nl> ""So what'd they have you in for?  And what *are* you?  Never seen anything like you in the bestiary."" <nl> He frowned down at the impertient man.  ""*Bestiary?*  You think to label us as mere animals?  Men have been picked clean straight down to the bones for a fraction of that insult, you fool.""  He sniffed.  ""If you *must* ask, I suppose I can enlighten you.  I'm a night-haunt.  An Eternal, not a *human*.  An extramortal.""  He raised one eyebrow at the men. <nl> ""An answer for an answer.  Who are you?  Is my sentence complete?""  He wanted it to be over.  So very badly.  He *needed* the sensation of hot blood in his mouth again, of tearing through flesh. <nl> They looked between each other.  And then they looked back at him. <nl> ""Uh.  Sentence?""  Paro said, scratching his head.  ""Sorry, big guy, but we're just scavengers.  Been through these ruins a dozen times, but we only just got that door there uncovered last month.""  He grinned.  ""Just *knew* there had to be something good in there."" <nl> He shook his head impatiently. <nl> ""Ruins?  What are you *talking* about.  The human's prison?  Don't be foolish.""  His fingers flexed on the bars.  ""Where are the arbiters?  Why has no one come?  Surely my sentence is complete."" <nl> ""Just...what's going on?""  Alton mumbled, his eyes flicking to his friend.  Paro shook his head. <nl> ""Uh- Well, you see.  This isn't a prison.  It's abandonded.  Has been since the Uprising.""  His words trailed off awkwardly.  The night-haunt shook his head. <nl> ""Uprising?""  He grated.  ""What is *that*?  This is nonsense.  I want to leave.  Let me out."" <nl> ""No.  *No*.  Paro, we're *leaving*.""  Alton said, his eyes narrow and angry.  He grabbed his friend's arm.  Paro didn't move. <nl> ""Sure.  I'll let you out.  But....a few questions, first.""  He cocked his head to the side.  ""I've *heard* of night-haunts before.  Old book I found once.  Haven't been seen in millenia.""  He grinned.  ""Says they're demons.  Are you a demon?"" <nl> The night-haunt bared his teeth at the young man, who didn't even flinch. <nl> ""You insulting piece of filth.  I told you.  I'm an *Eternal*.""  He sighed, and finished begrudgingly.  ""But.  Yes.  Some among the pathetic human masses referred to us as demons."" <nl> ""Splendid.""  Paro said, clapping his hands.  ""Then, I have a proposal for you."" <nl> ""Paro!  Stop.""  Alton ran back, still pulling on his friend's arm.  ""This is *stupid*.  You're playing with fire.  Let's go.  Now."" <nl> Paro shook him off, still watching the night-haunt. <nl> ""Hush.  We'll never get this chance again!  I can't pass it up.  Just picture the look on old Galen's face.  We'd be unstoppable."" <nl> He grinned, revealing two rows of perfect, shining white teeth.  It wasn't a pleasant expression. <nl> ""Become my familiar.  Take the blood oath, swear yourself to me.  Become my servant, now and forever, and I'll let you out."" <nl> (/r/Inorai, critiques always welcome!) <eos>

"<sos> ""Anything?"" Detective Phillips asks with a tired edge to his voice. Next to him stands another suspect, another person picked up under some pretense and brought in for me to see. <nl> I stare at the man from the comfort of an old office chair that apparently had padding made of rough stones. Shifting my weight for the eighteenth time, I momentarily see myself through the stranger's eyes. <nl> This is how it starts. I like to call it the empathic chain reaction. First, I become them for a split second--seeing what they see, hearing what they hear--before reaching inside for their most closely guarded secret. <nl> *A cluttered kitchen. Pots and pans, all with heavy scrims of grease and grime, lay on counters next to tilting pillars of plates and other dirty dishes. I (he) moves toward a large crock pot and lifts the glass lid. A puff of condensation rises in the air as the beads of sweat drip from the lid onto the floor. I hear them splatter on the kitchen floor. The sour sick smell of death invades the room from the small pot. The water inside is a black goop with a still body inside. I see a collar floating up at the surface with a barely legible name: Sprinkles.* <nl> Just as I (he) dips a hand into the fetid mess, I stop the vision. Back in my own body, my skin feels cold and damp with sweat. My neck is tight with the need to hold back my lunch. <nl> ""It's not him,"" I manage to say. ""But you might want to check around his neighborhood; people who've had their pets go missing."" <nl> Phillips shakes his head and shoves the guy in the shoulder, leading him away. <nl> ""Really scraping the bottom of the goddamned barrel now."" Detective Wilson, sitting next to me, places a hand on my arm. She looks into my eyes, with that way of hers, as if her super power is to put people at ease with a look and a touch. ""You okay to go on?"" <nl> I say a need a minute. Phantom smells from that last man's kitchen linger and I need to move around, get the feel that I'm back in my own body. Sometimes it can be difficult when a vision is as vivid as the last one. <nl> ""You,"" she says in a timid voice. ""You've never used that trick of yours on me, have you?"" <nl> ""No,"" I lie. I could never bring myself to confess that I've been in that dimly lit hospital room, waiting for my (her) daughter's long suffering to just end already. The guilt of knowing how selfish I (she) was in that moment to wish such a thing. <nl> ""We've done thousands of these,"" she says and picks up several polaroids. Each one contains a face of a recent suspect. Underneath, in the white section, written in neat black marker, a sentence or two describing the secrets that I've uncovered. ""Big score on this guy,"" she says, holding up 'A. Johnson'. ""Likes to lick public door knobs."" <nl> ""Carry hand-sanitizer with me at all times since,"" I say. A weak smile breaks over my face, but then I see the collar in the crock pot in my mind's eye and the good humor dies a quick death. <nl> Reading the room perfectly, knowing I need a distraction, Wilson holds up another. ""Or take this woman--likes to steal used nappies from her neighbor's bin."" <nl> I can't help but laugh from the British turn of phrases she often uses. Nappies and bins, I think, what a cute way to describe such a disgusting vision. I didn't mention to Phillips and Wilson what the woman did with those nappies, that she liked to strap them onto her baby dolls that she kept around the house, pretending they were real so she could change them later as she sang theme songs to various television shows. <nl> Wilson next holds up a photo of a well-groomed man. Dark hair cut short with a trim beard along a strong jaw. The name he'd given was simply the letter B. Try as they might, they couldn't get so much as a second initial. <nl> ""Graffiti artist."" Wilson turns the polaroid to her face and raises an appreciative eyebrow. ""You say he's the famous guy, likes to do those artsy paintings around town?"" <nl> ""It's what I saw, yeah."" I remember feeling that, although he was a vandal, it had been so wholesome compared to all the others. Creating art along a slab of drab concrete or a crumbling overpass. ""I can still recall the fluid way I (he) moved my (his) arm, spraying the--"" <nl> ""What?"" Wilson sets the photo down, uncrosses her legs, and leans forward. ""Howie, what is it?"" <nl> ""The vision--the Opening of the Heavens--he'd painted it across the street from the Mercury Theatre."" My heart is racing from the realization. ""The first bombing."" <nl> Her chair clatters to the floor as she jumps to her feet. Wilson races to the wall where a map of the city has been hung. Yellow background with blue streets criss-cross in all directions. Black thumb tacks indicate all of the recent attacks. Wilson's finger drags along the paper, connecting each tack. She whispers a title each time, ""Motherless Future. The Human Zoo. Water for Deserts."" <nl> She turns to me and then over at the polaroid. It's where she left it, on her desk. For the first time I notice the small smirk on B's face. Was he trying to tell us something then; the hidden truth behind his street art. <nl> ""Didn't the paper say they've found a new installation outside Metro Station?"" I ask. ""The one with the giant bees holding rifles?"" <nl> Her eyes go wide. ""Killer bees."" <eos>

"<sos> The first and final blow had been struck, a bolt of purple lightning that tore open the sky and shattered the ground beneath them. The clouds that had been the herald of the spell now burst, sending a torrent of rain over the broken earth and bodies of the people that had come to challenge the necromancer. <nl> He scoffed at the feeble attempt, lifting his hand, now with a sickly green aura, and began the rite to add these new, brave or stupid souls to his army. After a minute of the spell however, he was surprised to find that even though he was positive his spell had killed all of them, nothing was happening. The lightning should have ripped some of them in half, and he could see that their bodies, while whole, were thrown and scattered in unnatural positions. <nl> He made his way over to the closest and was just a few feet away before he noticed the faint golden aura of divinity outlining their body. The necromancer lowered himself to a crouch, using his staff as a support, and reached out to turn the person over. Spell or no, he was certain that this person was most assuredly dead, but kept sanctified by some god's power. Now that he had a better look, he could tell that the insignia on the helmet was of Marsell, the god of combat. *For being chosen by the gods these warriors were certainly disappoi--* <nl> A gurgling scream burst from behind the helmet as the body suddenly shuddered with pain. The necromancer himself nearly fell back from the surprise, but didn't move otherwise. He could hear the other warriors violently, painfully coming back to life around him, but he kept his eyes locked on Marsell's warrior, listening to their rattled and labored breathing. <nl> ""My friend, it seems you've gotten yourself in the wrong line of work,"" the necromancer taunted. ""Everyone knows gods aren't to be trusted. And now here you are, at my feet. Maybe your god can mend your bones, but it would only be for me to smash them again."" The body trembled, the armor gentle clacking as the faint sound of a sob escaped the helmet. The necromancer became furious, standing slowly before driving his foot down onto the lightning blasted breastplate. <nl> ""I denounce the gods, call my army, ravage their temples, and this is the best they offer? A sniveling,"" he brought his foot up and sharply down, ""weak,"" again, ""pathetic,"" again, ""pawn?!"" He was screaming now, his voice echoing across the destroyed earth. He was vaguely aware of a voice begging him to stop from further away, and in response he stepped off the body and lifted them up by the neck with a giant spectral hand. ""Let me see the face of the one the gods would call their champion,"" the necromancer growled and ripped the helmet off. <nl> The face was young. Even through the blood that was beginning to color the girl's long platinum hair there was the undeniable signs of youth. Her face had just begun to slim into the face of the woman she'd become, and her features were the kind of soft that only a carefree child has. The necromancer took a startled step back, dropping the helmet and this time nearly tripping over himself. <nl> The girl's ice-blue eyes opened, streaming tears, and breathed out, ""S-stop. It hurts. Please, stop it."" One of her arms lifted weakly towards her throat, sobbing out, ""Make it stop."" <nl> The necromancer didn't bother to check the others. If the gods had sent one child, he didn't care to temper himself by confirming they had sent four more. He lowered her gently onto the ground. He thought of explaining this divine curse she'd been subject to but knew it wouldn't help her understand the pain. She'd grow to hate her god as much as she'd hate him, but that wasn't the path he was on. <nl> He crouched down next to her, gently laying a glowing hand on her face. She flinched and sobbed, but the magic that seeped into her would dull the pain for a long time. He forced himself to go to the others, not having the will to look under their helmets but giving them the same reprieve from the pain.  Long enough, he hoped, that he'd either kill the gods and end their curse or they'd repair them on their own. <nl> By the time he'd made his way back to the first, she had drawn her sword and was shakily holding it up in the air, as of her idea would be to be poised to trick him to falling on it. He crouched beside her again, lowering her arm and gently speaking, ""Shh. That's enough now. You did very well, and I'm proud of you. They shouldn't have done this to you, but it's not your fault."" <nl> He looked up at the sky with a renewed sense of purpose. The world was aching, bending to the point of shattering because of the gods. He looked down at his fallen foes--no, these were not enemies of his. The battered children, soldiers of the gods' war. <nl> ""If you ever stand again, I'd like you to come and find me. Maybe then, if I haven't done what I need to do you'll be able to take care of me."" The necromancer pulled his hood down and smiled at the girl. Age had certainly taken him, but the platinum hair and blue eyes instantly sparked a memory in the girl of a simpler time, before the war had taken her-- <nl> ""I'm sorry."" <nl> The necromancer stood, pulling his hood over his face and walking away, eyes locked in a fiery rage towards the sky. Behind him, the girl sobbed again, crying out for the gods, her mother, her father. <eos>

"<sos> Jason and Aelia locked eyes across the vast expanse of their crowded rooms, separated by far more than just the glass between them. On the stage in the front a 4-armed DJ in his own isolated booth pumped the same music through both halves of the club, fusing the mass of species together to the tune of the pounding bass. <nl> The two made their way down mirrored staircases and into their respective crowds, Aelia's side a riot of shapes, colors, and humming atmospheric scrubbers. Jason's, by contrast, seemed almost uniform despite the presence of humans of every nationality and description. <nl> For most of those who came to *Club Penumbra* the experience was something akin to a combined freak show and concert, like going to a zoo to see all the creatures that might kill you on the other side of the glass. <nl> For the two lovers it was date night.

"<sos> I woke up that fateful day to see my wife sleeping next to me, with the number 1,492,316 above her head. I slipped out of bed to brush my teeth, and saw a 6 floating over my head. ""Hmm, wonder what that means,"" I murmured to my reflection as I washed my face. Ever since God started answering prayers again, things had been kind of weird around here. You never knew when it would start raining frogs. On the other hand, wine was dirt cheap now, so everyone was happy (except for the vineyard owners). <nl> As I drove to work, I saw people in their cars around me, all with numbers over their heads. When I got to work, my boss greeted me. ""Hey Mark, how are you?"" He had 4,204,399 above his head. ""Wow! You're a 6? Seriously?"" His beady eyes flicked around the room, looking at everyone else's numbers. I looked around too. Everyone else had numbers in the millions and billions. <nl> ""Yeah, I just woke up with this number over my head. What does it mean?"" <nl> ""Don't you read the newspaper?"" My boss dragged me over to the waiting room, where a copy of the New York Times was lying on the table. On the front page, in bold letters, it read, ""GOD JUDGES HUMANITY - IMPORTANCE OF EACH PERSON QUANTIFIED."" I skimmed it quickly. It seemed that the lower each person was, the more important they were in God's eyes. <nl> I put down the paper. ""There must be some mistake,"" I stammered. ""I'm no one special."" <nl> My boss clapped me on my shoulder. ""Well, seems you're special to God! This will be great publicity!"" He bustled over to one of the interns, to talk to him about setting up a sign advertising that we employed ... well, me. <nl> I called my wife. ""Honey, have you heard about this numbering thing?"" <nl> ""Yes, I just woke up,"" she said. ""Seems sort of strange to me.

Now that he's answering prayers concretely, I'm sure he'll tell you what's going on. After all, you're number 6."" <nl> I didn't have the patience to wait until after work. During my lunch break, I went to the bathroom and started praying. ""Dear God. Sorry to bother you, but uh, I wanted to ask you... Why 6? I mean, why am I so important?"" <nl> God replied in a quiet voice that echoed inside my head. ""My son, have you not heard that it is the meek who will inherit the earth? You are extraordinary in your ordinariness. You live with your wife, trying to do right by your neighbors and fellow people. You show your neighbors what it means to be human."" <nl> I was quiet for a second. ""Thank you, God. If I may be so bold as to ask... Who is number 1, then?"" <nl> God laughed, a gentle sound that sent my spirits soaring. ""There is this person who spends her time posting videos of her cats online. They are so adorable! Her videos help people to love their fellow animals."" <nl> I thought about it. ""Are you sure it's not just because you're a huge fan?"" <nl> I felt a wave of love wash over me.

"<sos> ""We have it, sir."" <nl> ""Excellent,"" I said, ""now hurry up and put her in the interrogation chamber."" <nl> ""Sir!"" The soldier rushed to comply and hoisted the repulsive thing, still passed out, and tied her to a chair. <nl> ""Make sure its binds are secured,"" I told him, ""we don't want her getting free."" <nl> I sat across from the captive, I wanted her to see me when she first regained consciousness, to know that her life was over. <nl> I didn't have to wait long. Soon the thing stirred, and reflexively strained against her bonds. I stiffened for a second, but the creature gave up, unable to break free. I let out a shaky breath that I didn't even realize I had been holding. <nl> Soon it opened its sharp blue eyes suddenly and looked right at me. To its credit, it didn't flinch. <nl> I gave it a smile. <nl> ""So Madame Chair, is it?"" I said, savoring the moment, ""welcome to hell."" <nl> Her eyes flickered about, taking in the sights, my red skin, pointy tail, my horns. The temperature, which humans find uncomfortable apparently, and the sharp odor of brimstone. And just for a moment her cool facade slipped, a crack in her mask, and her eyes widened slightly, her lips parted. <nl> And then it was gone as swiftly as it had come. But I saw it, I saw the thing's fear. It felt good to know that their leader could feel it. <nl> She looked at me again, with that same intense gaze that commanded authority, it was no wonder she became the leader of the Earth Congress. ""It's a little warm,"" she said, actually managing to smile, ""and these bonds are a bit too tight, do you mind loosening them?"" <nl> I laughed mirthlessly, the laughter not reaching my eyes. Laughed at the courage of this woman, her ability to make jokes, to retain some semblance of control despite her situation. Laughed at our final victory. <nl> ""I see through your facade, Madame, talk all you want, you'll be doing a lot of that whether you want it or not soon enough. You know this not a welcoming party."" <nl> ""So,"" she said, leaning back and managing to look as comfortable as possible in her bonds, ""let's skip the part where I refuse to tell you my plans, and you scare and intimidate me, and then you torture me so much that I eventually give in and tell you everything anyways, just that time without my fingers."" <nl> ""Let's start simply then,"" I said, slightly uncomfortable by her forthright manner, ""how did you invade hell?"" We already knew the answer to this, and we suspected the humans did not know that we knew. I wanted to test her honesty. <nl> She shrugged. ""It was simple really, we managed to reverse engineer-"" I held up my hand. <nl> ""I'm sorry, reverse engineer?"" I asked, not knowing the phrase. <nl> ""To build something by looking at a complete version,"" she explained. I motioned for her to continue. She nodded, ""Yes...reverse engineer one of your imp nests that spawned imps from hell directly to Earth, and managed to make a device that does the opposite. This also gave us the space-time co-ordinates of hell, so we knew where and when to go."" <nl> I pretended to frown, as if thinking if this would work, but my mind was racing. She was telling the truth, we had lost an imp nest and we had figured that's how the humans had made their way back in. <nl> ""Alright, let's continue. Where will the human forces be retreating?"" <nl> She pretended to look confused, ""I'm sorry, what do you mean retreat?"" <nl> I smiled savagely. ""Do you take us for fools, Madame Chair? You think we would infiltrate the very heart of your planet and capture you just to ask questions? No, you know as well as we do that we have cut off the head of the snake, without you the humans will halt their offensive."" <nl> And what an offensive it had been. In the first months of 2021 we had pushed the humans back, taking their cities and killing their people. But after the surprise had faded the humans had pushed back. *Hard*. Their...technology let them perform wonders that we thought they were incapable of. We could launch fireballs but they could shoot iron balls from some sort of hand held device. We had demons with wings, but they flew in metal birds. We had leviathans in the oceans but they had steel titans that sailed *on* the oceans. <nl> We were pushed back, and had retreated to hell after extensive casualties. We thought we would lick our wounds, bide our time, strike when the humans were weak, when we became a myth once again. We had the patience for millennia after all. <nl> But then they came to us. <nl> They tore into us, like insects they marched across the planes of oblivion, destroying our structures, freeing our prisoners. They recruited long dead humans, the most vicious of them, and turned them against us. They had marched to the palace of hell itself, seeking to capture our leader, the Devil himself.  Without him we would fall apart, the different species of demons would turn on each other, and the war would be over. <nl> But that had not happened. And I turned back to the woman gloating, ""Just as we cannot fight without our leader, your humans will crumble without you. They are finished."" <nl> Her face had paled, and I bore on, ""don't worry though, we will not kill you, we will keep you alive for a *long* time, before your release comes and you go to heaven, longer that you would have lived on Earth."" I paused dramatically, savoring the look of utter fear on her face,  ""Of course you might not find it as...comfortable as Earth."" <nl> I had expected her to cower, to cry, perhaps even revert back to her stoic mask, not showing emotions. <nl> I did not expect her to laugh. <nl> ""You fools, you sorry, poor fools!"" She said, gasping for breath. ""I..I just couldn't keep up the act anymore, my God."" I flinched as she said the last word, but remained confused. <nl> ""I was told you didn't understand human psychology, but delusion of this scale I had not even imagined."" She was actually crying from laughter, and now *she* smiled smugly at me. ""I have a second, you idiot, I will be replaced and the humans will continue attacking. This is not some sort of movie where if you kill the leader, all the underlings fall apart. Killing me does nothing."" <nl> I sat back, stunned. She had been acting, pretending to be afraid, pretending to show her 'true' emotions. And the human assault would not stop. ""You lie!"" I screamed at her, ""all species' fall without their leader. You kill a pack leader and you become leader, you kill the Devil and the demons fall apart. This is the nature of the world!"" <nl> She just continued laughing. <nl> The Devil needed to be evacuated! The humans may not need their leader but we did. I turned to shout orders to the soldiers outside, and they hurried away, reporting to the Devil. <nl> I turned back to the woman. ""Your humans may advance, but you will not, we captured you, and rest assured you will not see the light of day again."" <nl> She stopped laughing and smiled at me. A smile that chilled me to the bone. ""What the hell makes you think you were capable enough to capture me...if we didn't let you."" <nl> The soldier I had commanded to report to the devil returned, one of the human hand devices in his hand, and pointed it at me. <nl> ""Betrayal,"" I whispered. Then, fiercely, I turned to the soldier, ""Traitor!"" <nl> He shrugged, untying the human's bonds. ""I like to be on the winning side."" <nl> The woman, now free from her bonds turned to me. ""Thank you for bringing me to the most secure location in hell. The tracker I have swallowed has alerted my forces where this is. We will release the most fearsome humans in history from this facility."" <nl> She turned to walk away. ""Kill it,"" she said in a dismissive gesture, ""we have work to do."" <nl> ""Sorry boss,"" the soldier said with a casual shrug, and shot me. <nl> Blackness ensued. <nl> *** <nl> (minor edits) <nl> If you enjoyed, check out my new subreddit [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/) <nl> **Due to popular demand, I present to you, [Part 2!](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5hk0nq/wp_2021_hell_invades_earth_2022_earth_invades_hell/db1got6/)** <nl> EDIT: /u/YouWriteITalk was kind enough to narrate this story.

No, you know as well as we do that we have cut off the head of the snake, without you the humans will halt their offensive."" <nl> And what an offensive it had been. In the first months of 2021 we had pushed the humans back, taking their cities and killing their people. But after the surprise had faded the humans had pushed back. *Hard*. Their...technology let them perform wonders that we thought they were incapable of. We could launch fireballs but they could shoot iron balls from some sort of hand held device. We had demons with wings, but they flew in metal birds. We had leviathans in the oceans but they had steel titans that sailed *on* the oceans. <nl> We were pushed back, and had retreated to hell after extensive casualties. We thought we would lick our wounds, bide our time, strike when the humans were weak, when we became a myth once again. We had the patience for millennia after all. <nl> But then they came to us. <nl> They tore into us, like insects they marched across the planes of oblivion, destroying our structures, freeing our prisoners. They recruited long dead humans, the most vicious of them, and turned them against us. They had marched to the palace of hell itself, seeking to capture our leader, the Devil himself.  Without him we would fall apart, the different species of demons would turn on each other, and the war would be over. <nl> But that had not happened. And I turned back to the woman gloating, ""Just as we cannot fight without our leader, your humans will crumble without you. They are finished."" <nl> Her face had paled, and I bore on, ""don't worry though, we will not kill you, we will keep you alive for a *long* time, before your release comes and you go to heaven, longer that you would have lived on Earth."" I paused dramatically, savoring the look of utter fear on her face,  ""Of course you might not find it as...comfortable as Earth."" <nl> I had expected her to cower, to cry, perhaps even revert back to her stoic mask, not showing emotions. <nl> I did not expect her to laugh. <nl> ""You fools, you sorry, poor fools!"" She said, gasping for breath. ""I..I just couldn't keep up the act anymore, my God."" I flinched as she said the last word, but remained confused. <nl> ""I was told you didn't understand human psychology, but delusion of this scale I had not even imagined."" She was actually crying from laughter, and now *she* smiled smugly at me. ""I have a second, you idiot, I will be replaced and the humans will continue attacking. This is not some sort of movie where if you kill the leader, all the underlings fall apart. Killing me does nothing."" <nl> I sat back, stunned. She had been acting, pretending to be afraid, pretending to show her 'true' emotions. And the human assault would not stop. ""You lie!"" I screamed at her, ""all species' fall without their leader. You kill a pack leader and you become leader, you kill the Devil and the demons fall apart. This is the nature of the world!"" <nl> She just continued laughing. <nl> The Devil needed to be evacuated! The humans may not need their leader but we did. I turned to shout orders to the soldiers outside, and they hurried away, reporting to the Devil. <nl> I turned back to the woman. ""Your humans may advance, but you will not, we captured you, and rest assured you will not see the light of day again."" <nl> She stopped laughing and smiled at me. A smile that chilled me to the bone. ""What the hell makes you think you were capable enough to capture me...if we didn't let you."" <nl> The soldier I had commanded to report to the devil returned, one of the human hand devices in his hand, and pointed it at me. <nl> ""Betrayal,"" I whispered. Then, fiercely, I turned to the soldier, ""Traitor!"" <nl> He shrugged, untying the human's bonds. ""I like to be on the winning side."" <nl> The woman, now free from her bonds turned to me. ""Thank you for bringing me to the most secure location in hell. The tracker I have swallowed has alerted my forces where this is. We will release the most fearsome humans in history from this facility."" <nl> She turned to walk away. ""Kill it,"" she said in a dismissive gesture, ""we have work to do."" <nl> ""Sorry boss,"" the soldier said with a casual shrug, and shot me. <nl> Blackness ensued. <nl> *** <nl> (minor edits) <nl> If you enjoyed, check out my new subreddit [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/) <nl> **Due to popular demand, I present to you, [Part 2!](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5hk0nq/wp_2021_hell_invades_earth_2022_earth_invades_hell/db1got6/)** <nl> EDIT: /u/YouWriteITalk was kind enough to narrate this story.

"<sos> As I walked in front of each gate, my head split with the memories of career fairs and the maze of booths to pave a path for my future. Wait, pain? A headache? I died. The reaper guided me here, why am I feeling pain? <nl> ""You must've arrived recently,"" declared a smart-dressed man as he approached me. I eyed him and the gates behind him. Marble pillars, Corinthian, maybe? Not like I ever remembered when I saw them in paintings or pictures. The man was pale but still had a tinge of olive skin and Mediterranean features. <nl> Reaching out with my hand, ""David, nice to meet you. How could you tell?"" <nl> ""Your eyes glazed a bit, you winced, then your face contorted in confusion. I'm guessing that you expected no pain. I've seen it countless times before. Hades. Sit, chat with me, you have the time now."" <nl> His voice was deep and smooth and persuasive without being commanding. I felt compelled to sit with him. ""What's going on around here?"" <nl> ""Observe. What seems to be happening?"" <nl> ""It looks like a recruitment drive...for the afterlife?"" <nl> ""Correct. I'm glad to know you're intelligent. Now, why do you think you're here?"" <nl> ""Well, I wasn't religious and didn't believe in God, or any god. I was kinda convinced to be more open-minded which made me realize that I never thought about religion, so how could I know anything? From then on, I've been agnostic. Hopeful that whatever the truth was, this world wouldn't tear itself apart from it. Granted, I think the truth was much needed when I hit my 30's."" <nl> ""Ya know Hades, ya keep 'avin heart-ta-hearts wit 'em, ya'll ne'er get'em in there!"" The callout came from literal left-field. We both turned to see another deity approaching. This one reminded me of a hippie-surfer dude but smelled more earthy and somehow the light made it hard to look at him. <nl> The thought immediately was replaced with fear as I made eye-contact with the crow on his shoulder. I couldn't look away and soon my whole body started to tense up. I didnt even know what I could do. Fight? Against gods?! What are they gonna do, kill me? Run? Better option, but from what? I'm going to have to see them again, plus they could chase me down easily. <nl> ""Don't frighten tha poor lad. Sorry bout that. Name's Lugh. Part of the Tuatha De Danaan. So whatcha speaken to this spooky bastard for?"" <nl> ""David, and I'm just trying to get my bearings. But I think I got it:  go up and talk to a god about joining the afterlife from that pantheon."" <nl> The crow ruffled itself and spoke in a soothing, almost sultry, voice:  ""You're partly there. We are trying to sell our afterlife to you. No need to apply and try to get in. If you want it, go after it."" <nl> When she said this, my mind started racing. Did my parents come through here? Where would they have gone? What about my wife? What if I waited for her? My kids?! What do I remember about all the afterlifes I know about from weird phases I had as teen and young adult? What did I want then? What do I want now?! <nl> ""What do I want? What do I want?"" I whispered to myself. Tears started to well up and trail down my face. After all this time, I still couldn't answer this simple question. Now, I have potentially an eternity to still not know. <nl> I stood without a word and walked back toward the entrance of the hall of gates. It didn't faze me how rude I was to three extremely powerful deities. I just walked listlessly back to where this all started. <nl> As I arrived at what seemed to be the entrance, how I wish this was an exit, the reaper who brought me appeared with another recently passed soul. We all startled each other, but she managed to get the other soul  to continue on into hall. No words between any of us and we just stood watching the hustle and bustle. <nl> ""Don't know what you wanna do?"" The reaper finally spoke up; I bet she was used to awkward silences. <nl> ""No. There's so much. Do I wait? Do I go to-"" <nl> ""Stop."" She held up a hand, paused, and then gestured toward the void she came from. ""Would you mind helping me?"" <nl> ""Sure........do I need a scythe or robes?"" <nl> ""You gonna be a pain in my ass, aren't you?"" <eos>

"<sos> Joe wrapped an arm around his wife's shoulders and pulled her tightly to his chest. Most of the residents of St Bartholomew's Street had already come out of their houses to see the cause of the midnight fracas. They were now gathered around the drive of number thirty-eight, as if patrons around a theatre stage, many of whom were hoping for a particularly blood thirsty production. Others, like Joe, were simply stuck in a state of disbelief. Of *refusing* to believe. <nl> Sarah looked up at her husband. ""They can't be, can they? We've known them for so long."" Joe felt her hand curl up into a ball against his back. ""They looked after the children only last week. Jesus Joe, we *trusted* them."" <nl> The Enforcers' Jeep waited empty, but eager, outside their neighbour's drive. A harsh light spiralled out from the vehicle, painting the gathered crowd first in broad red brushstrokes, then blue. Their neighbours' door lay splintered on the brick driveway. Joe shook his head. ""We- we don't know that they *are*, yet, sweetheart. Not until the Enforcers bring them out. Until then, I think they both deserve the benefit of the doubt. They've earned at least that much from us."" <nl> ""Amanda and Tony,"" his wife continued unperturbed, ""they just seemed so *normal*. Just like us. I suppose that was the point - it was all a... a *trick*. To get close to us, so that they could eventually..."" Her hands began to tremble. <nl> Joe took her hands in his own and held them tightly. He opened his mouth meaning to reassure her, when the Special Office Enforcers came striding out of the broken doorway. <nl> ""Oh God,"" cried Sarah as she watched her neighbours be dragged out of their house, towards the Jeep, their arms handcuffed behind their backs. ""How- how could you!"" she screamed at them. ""How sick are you freaks? We trusted you with our children!"" <nl> Amanda must have heard her, as she glanced up at Sarah. In that moment, Joe saw his neighbour's battered face and the blood dribbling from her nose. <nl> ""Go back to your own planet!"" Sarah spat. ""And take the rest of your kind with you! You're not welcome!"" <nl> ""Honey,"" said Joe, blinking back tears. ""Please. You don't mean that. They're our friends."" <nl> ""*Friends?* They're sick freaks, that's what they are! You've read the reports. The things they've done..."" <nl> ""You can't believe all that? Amanda and Tony have always been good t-"" <nl> A yell from nearby interrupted him. ""Show us their eyes!"" <nl> ""Yeah, their eyes!"" <nl> ""We want proof!"" <nl> The Enforcer who held Amanda, pulled her up to her feet. He took out a plastic device, that looked a little like a gun, from his jacket pocket. With one hand, he grabbed Amanda's hair and yanked her head back; with the other, he fired a wide, green beam into her face. Her eyes lit up a bloody, unnatural, red. There were screams and panicked gasps from the crowd. <nl> ""I God-damned knew it!"" said one resident. ""They've always been perfect. *Too* perfect!"" <nl> ""Hang 'em!"" said another. <nl> Tony, who was kneeling on the floor, pushed himself up and thrust himself head first at the Enforcer holding his wife. The Enforcer stumbled, almost falling, but at the last moment just regained her balance. Another Enforcer ran at Tony and threw his fist into the man's throat. The first Enforcer rejoined the fray, stamping her boot into the fallen man's head. <nl> Joe began to tremble. ""No..."" <nl> ""Honey?"" said Sarah. <nl> ""This isn't right,"" said Joe defiantly. ""It isn't right!"" <nl> ""Tell that to the children,"" said Sarah. ""This is *exactly* right. It's what they deserve."" <nl> A haze of red flashed from the Jeep as its light spun again; Joe saw his hands as the light spilled over  them. A moment later, a blue light replaced the red, washing it away. Only, the red wasn't gone. It would never go away, unless he... <nl> ""I'm sorry,"" he whispered, kissing his wife's hair. ""They may not be from here, but they're sure as hell human. And more than that, they're our friends."" <nl> Sarah screamed, pleading him not to, but he was already in mid sprint. His shoulder landed with a thud against against one of the Enforcers. A right hook took the other off her feet. <nl> ""It's okay,"" said Joe, offering a hand to the beaten, bloodied man. <nl> Tony looked up, through his one, non swollen eye. ""Thank you,"" he croaked. ""Are you one of..."" <nl> But the question was never finished. More officers had arrived. <nl> A gun shot. <nl> A bullet tore through Tony's head. <nl> A long streak of red spattered the street. <nl> Amanda's blood curdling scream cut through the noise of the frenzied crowd, until the hilt of a gun struck her head and silenced her. <nl> Joe stepped back in sick disbelief. ""No..."" he muttered. ""Oh God, no."" <nl> And then, they were on him. Fists and boots battering him down until he became numb and still. <nl> When finally satisfied, the Enforcers dragged Joe back to his feet. <nl> ""Show us his eyes!"" came a shout from the crowd. ""He's one of them for sure!"" ""Show us his eyes!"" <nl> A hand yanked back Joe's head. A fierce green light pierced his retinas. If he could have screamed, he would have done. <nl> ""He's not one of them,"" said a woman who lived two doors down from Joe. The blood-lusting crowd seemed to deflate slightly, shoulders slumping and heads turning. ""Just loves him some Second-Worlds."" <nl> ""That's bad enough, ain't it?!"" <nl> Joe saw his wife standing on the doorstep, watching him with tear streaked eyes. Jane and Thea had come to the door and Sarah had her arms wrapped around them, trying to comfort them. <nl> The green light was ripped away from his eyes. As it twisted direction, for a split second, it touched his wife's face. <nl> His entire body began to tremble. <nl> No one else saw: they were all too busy baying like wolves at Joe. <nl> He didn't mean to struggle again - it was instinctive - but it was all it took. <nl> Joe looked a last time at his his family, as a second gun fired. <nl> Sarah had tried to cover her children's eyes, but Thea saw it all through a gap between her mother's fingers. She saw the blood spurt out of her father's chest and his body fall limply to the ground. She saw the inhumanity and unfairness of it all, and felt all the weight of her species fall on her shoulders. Her eyes, if for only a second, burned a brighter red than any before. She squeezed her hand into a ball and made herself a promise. <eos>

"<sos> You know how older people always talk about how they remember major events? Stuff like how the weather was when Pearl Harbor was attacked, or how they were checking the news to see if they could call in to work for bad weather when the Twin Towers were hit? You know. The events that seem to change the world. <nl> Well. I have a strong smell that I recall when I think of the morning Neil Armstrong passed away. And I remember that same strong smell the evening he came back. <nl> It is the smell of badly burned coffee. <nl> Now, I'm no expert when it comes to making my coffee. In fact, I'm downright terrible at it. Sometimes I put too many grounds in the filter, sometimes I put too much instant cream into it. I'd accidentally left my cheap coffee maker running that morning while I was rushing to throw another leg into my slacks. As I fumbled with the misshapen knot that I tried to tie my tie into, the crisp, earthy smell of singed Folgers wafting in from the kitchen, I heard the familiar DOO DOO DE DO DOO of a ""Breaking News!"" story from my TV. <nl> ""We at KWTF News are sad to inform you that Neil Armstrong, first man on the moon, was tragically hit by a semi-truck this morning, which had careened wildly from the icy stretch of highway next to Mr. Armstrong's car. The truck, carrying lighting equipment from the famous Disney On I--"" <nl> ""Man, that sucks..."" I lifted my thumb from the depressed power button on my television's remote control, slid my feet into my already-tied shoes (Mom always says that will ruin the backs of my shoes. Take that, Mom.) and dashed out the door, five minutes late for work already. <nl> With the clarity that hindsight provides, I now know I forgot to turn off my coffee pot's heater. <nl> \*\*\*\*\* <nl> Twelve and a half hours later, I turned past the half-staffed flag of the nearby bank and slowly slid back into the parking lot next to my apartment. It had been a terrible, long, and terrible day. Hours of useless meetings, useless phone calls, and useless managers yelling at me to fix whatever the new issue of the hour was. Oh, and one moment of silence for poor Mr. Armstrong. Our CEO had ushered us all into the parking lot. He said another of his long-winded speeches and then forced us all to take a moment of silence before ushering us back in and promptly sending an email saying we now had to skip our break because we lost time honoring An American Hero, and hey, while we're at it, why not work some mandatory overtime too? <nl> I don't think anyone mentioned anything other than Neil's passing all day. At least not while their noses weren't pressing up against their computer monitors. Coworkers, updated podcasts, even the local church's signboard; Neil Armstrong's death was all that was spoken of that day. So, you can imagine my exasperated sigh when I finally got home, flung my shoes off my feet, and turned on the TV to see a special about Neil Armstrong and his life and his death and his blah blah blah. <nl> I really wasn't paying attention, but I was just too tired to work up the energy to change the channel. My focus was on my wrinkled nose, and on the awful, awful stench of coffee that had been slowly burning away all day, the smell infesting my apartment. ""It's a miracle no one called the fire department on me,"" I moaned as I took the pot off the burner and finally switched the coffee maker off. I'd just started to pour the contents of the stained pot out when I heard the annoyingly familiar jingle. <nl> DOO DOO DE DO DOO. <nl> ""Oh, now what?"" Impatient and irate, I put the pot back down and stared at the television. Did I have to suffer through yet another windbag speech on what a hero Armstrong was? <nl> Was that a shot of the moon? Did China launch a manned expedition or something? <nl> ""We at KWTF News are... Well, frankly, we're baffled to be brining you this news. It seems that... yes, just a few moments ago, NASA scientists took some new photographs of our moon's surface. And it seems that..."" The bald newscaster mopped his always-sweaty pate before nervously continuing, ""Well, it sounds ridiculous, but it seems that our American flags, planted on the moon by our brave astronauts through many trips to the place, well... All six of them are now at half-staff. NASA is now hosting a live video feed on their website, which we will be featuring for the next few--"" <nl> What? <nl> No, I meant it. What? What just happened? How did that even make sense? Who would have even been able to do that? No, wait, scratch that, HOW did they even do that? Weren't those flags solid assemblies, all glued together and stuff? How would you even GET the flags to lower, much less get up there TO lower them? And, wait, there was more than one of them? <nl> The anchor continued to drone on while I took out my way-too-big phone and began to look up information about the moon landings. I was so invested in digging through search engines that I almost missed the old anchor cursing a few minutes later. <nl> ""Fuck! Holy fucking shit, what is that!?"" Wait, since when did they allow that kind of language on network TV? The news anchor's sweat from his red forehead was flying everywhere as the he got up from his desk and began to march offscreen. ""No, YOU calm down, Frank! Unless you know what that fucking thing is, you don't tell me--"" <nl> The news station was still showing NASA's livestream of one of the flags on the moon. And next to the flag was... Was that static? A blob of static, right next to the flag, moving around? It looked like an arm, moving up and down, almost like it was waving. <nl> I finally stumped over to my couch, my mouth gaping wide open. As I sat down, the static began to fade. As it did, you could almost make out something still there, something where the static was. Whoever was controlling the stream noticed too, because they tried their best to zoom in on what was becoming clear was a figure. <nl> Neil Armstrong, the same old face I'd seen posted all over my social media feeds and work emails all day, was waving at me. I mean, not at me, but I could swear the guy was staring right at me, through the TV. I couldn't help but give a tiny wave back. This man, this impossibly dead man stopped waving as soon as my hand fluttered. He gave a satisfied nod and a formal salute, and then... He was swallowed by static again as the image faded away, to be replaced with a screen made in the 90's that stated ""Technical Issues - We'll Be Right Back!"" <nl> After a few minutes of stunned silence, I got back up and stumped over to the half-emptied coffee pot and finished pouring it out. But even without the coffee, I didn't get any sleep that night. <eos>
","I really wasn't paying attention, but I was just too tired to work up the energy to change the channel. My focus was on my wrinkled nose, and on the awful, awful stench of coffee that had been slowly burning away all day, the smell infesting my apartment.<nl>",8,"<sos> You know how older people always talk about how they remember major events? Stuff like how the weather was when Pearl Harbor was attacked, or how they were checking the news to see if they could call in to work for bad weather when the Twin Towers were hit? You know. The events that seem to change the world. <nl> Well. I have a strong smell that I recall when I think of the morning Neil Armstrong passed away. And I remember that same strong smell the evening he came back. <nl> It is the smell of badly burned coffee. <nl> Now, I'm no expert when it comes to making my coffee. In fact, I'm downright terrible at it. Sometimes I put too many grounds in the filter, sometimes I put too much instant cream into it. I'd accidentally left my cheap coffee maker running that morning while I was rushing to throw another leg into my slacks. As I fumbled with the misshapen knot that I tried to tie my tie into, the crisp, earthy smell of singed Folgers wafting in from the kitchen, I heard the familiar DOO DOO DE DO DOO of a ""Breaking News!"" story from my TV. <nl> ""We at KWTF News are sad to inform you that Neil Armstrong, first man on the moon, was tragically hit by a semi-truck this morning, which had careened wildly from the icy stretch of highway next to Mr. Armstrong's car. The truck, carrying lighting equipment from the famous Disney On I--"" <nl> ""Man, that sucks..."" I lifted my thumb from the depressed power button on my television's remote control, slid my feet into my already-tied shoes (Mom always says that will ruin the backs of my shoes. Take that, Mom.) and dashed out the door, five minutes late for work already. <nl> With the clarity that hindsight provides, I now know I forgot to turn off my coffee pot's heater. <nl> \*\*\*\*\* <nl>I really wasn't paying attention, but I was just too tired to work up the energy to change the channel. My focus was on my wrinkled nose, and on the awful, awful stench of coffee that had been slowly burning away all day, the smell infesting my apartment.<nl><nl> Twelve and a half hours later, I turned past the half-staffed flag of the nearby bank and slowly slid back into the parking lot next to my apartment. It had been a terrible, long, and terrible day. Hours of useless meetings, useless phone calls, and useless managers yelling at me to fix whatever the new issue of the hour was. Oh, and one moment of silence for poor Mr. Armstrong. Our CEO had ushered us all into the parking lot. He said another of his long-winded speeches and then forced us all to take a moment of silence before ushering us back in and promptly sending an email saying we now had to skip our break because we lost time honoring An American Hero, and hey, while we're at it, why not work some mandatory overtime too? <nl> I don't think anyone mentioned anything other than Neil's passing all day. At least not while their noses weren't pressing up against their computer monitors. Coworkers, updated podcasts, even the local church's signboard; Neil Armstrong's death was all that was spoken of that day. So, you can imagine my exasperated sigh when I finally got home, flung my shoes off my feet, and turned on the TV to see a special about Neil Armstrong and his life and his death and his blah blah blah. <nl> I really wasn't paying attention, but I was just too tired to work up the energy to change the channel.

"<sos> ""Good morning, beautiful,"" Ross says as he shuts off his alarm and rolls over to kiss his wife before he gets up. Really, Ross? You selfish shit. She doesn't need to get up for another hour, and there you go making sure she can't get another REM cycle in before she wakes up. What kind of sleep-depriving, torturous sadist does that? Guantanamo level shit, Ross. <nl> He sneaks into the guest bathroom for a quick shower before work. Instead of his own bathroom. Another bathroom for his wife to clean. It's hopeless anyways. He smells like BO no matter what. And nobody likes him at work either. And then once he's downstairs, he stops to pet the cats for a minute. Instead of emptying the dishwasher. Ross is lazy. The cats think so, too. Everybody does. <nl> He parks outside - he claims so that the opening and closing of the garage doesn't wake up his wife but it's actually because he hates the world - so now he's out there doing his best to destroy the environment. The car runs and runs, it's been like ten minutes and he comes out now that it's warm enough. Really, Ross? Man up and go to work in the cold. Do you think the Amish heat up their buggies? Do you think laborers in the gulag wait for it to get warmer? No. They just go to work. <nl> Ross smiles as he drives, pretending he's so much better than all the other commuters. Everybody glares at him because he sucks at driving. He slowly rolls into roundabouts instead of just committing. He stops on yellow lights. He waves pedestrians on like some sort of psychotic serial killer by proxy who just wants them to get slammed by an oncoming truck. <nl> ""Good morning, Sandra,"" he says with a smile to the receptionist when he enters the office. She's a lonely, unpleasant old person. Just like Ross will be someday. Nobody wants to talk to her and she doesn't want to talk to anybody. But Ross still talks to her, just to make her morning a little worse. Sandra smiles at him. They have this little ritual they do where Ross fake smiles and acts all pleasant, hiding the fact that he thinks that Sandra is the worst receptionist in the world and he would rather sprinkle roach dust into his coffee than talk to her. Too bad there are no roaches around. He deserves them. <nl> ""Hey, buddy,"" Alan says as Ross makes his way to his desk. See? Ross is so immemorable that even his cubicle neighbor can't remember his name. Ross has a picture of his wife on his desk. That's so he doesn't forget what she looks like because Ross is terrible with faces and terrible with names and terrible with everybody in general. <nl> ""Alan, how was your weekend?"" Ross says with that same fake smile. Then he really puts Alan through the grinder, torturing him with not one, not two - not three through nine either - but *ten* minutes of small-talk. You cruel, pitiless pile of walking shit, Ross. Ten minutes wasted. Ten minutes of company time. Ten minutes that Alan will never get back. Give it another ten minutes - by the time Ross is done with his paid poop - and he won't even remember what Alan said. ""How's Becky?"" It's Rebecca, Ross. Alan's wife is Rebecca. Not Becky. She's not your side-chick. You're not that personal. Keep it professional, Ross. <nl> Alan is smiling. It's a tortured smile, I can tell. It's just a little too wide. A little too happy for a Monday morning during Ross-time. Nobody likes Ross-time. Not even his wife. Ross is probably thinking about something else right now, instead of listening to this poor soul going on and on about his weekend. Once their useless and forced chit-chat is over, Ross sits at his desk. He clears his throat and then quickly says ""excuse me"". Really, Ross? Is that necessary? It's annoying and churlish and really just adds to the irritating ambient noise that is only exacerbated by your insufferable presence. Silence is golden, Ross.

It was feared that, after the site fell into the hands of the Islamic State, it would be bulldozed or broken up and sold piece by piece on the black market. Thankfully for archaeology, it was not to be. <nl> A few months later, the researchers were wishing the terrorists had destroyed the whole damn thing and saved them the trouble. <nl> The site was called ""The Temple of the Serpent"". Supposedly a shrine in a town for Israelites and proto-Christians kicked out of Judea and Palestine, it was a religious complex buried under several feet of sand and rubble on the Syrian-Iraqi border.

It was assumed that this serpent was the herald of Satan Mekratrig, the devil of the Abrahamic faiths. As shocking as this discovery was, however, it was the uncovering of a series of texts in ancient Greek that would shake the foundations of Western society as they knew it. <nl> The texts claimed that humans were not created by Yahweh, as claimed in Genesis, but rather the product of a relationship between a fallen angel named Araquiel and his succubus lover. Their copulation led to the first ""human"", Adam, with Eve being self-created by the succubus as a mate for their child. Yahweh feared what these humans were capable of, believing them to have the abilities of both angels and demons, so he stole them and put them in the Garden of Eden, telling them that they were his creations. But the serpent, sent by their true parents, sought to make them aware of the truth. But outright telling them would alert Yahweh immediately. So the snake took a roundabout approach: he told the humans to eat from the tree of knowledge, knowing with enough bites, the two humans would learn the truth and forge their own destiny, as their parents intended. <nl> However, as in Genesis, Adam and Eve were caught and expelled from Eden, cursed to never be able to leave the Earth via gravity. But the Cult of the Snake was formed, with the goal of working in the shadows to untap humanity's full potential and usher a new golden age for mankind. <nl> Most of the researchers dismissed the tale as yet another Gnostic conspiracy.

"<sos> I ducked under the flying book with practiced ease and it slammed into the wall behind me. <nl> ""Abarakadabum!!"" <nl> My mother was fond of screaming made up spell names during her nightly drinking sessions. <nl> She laughed and subsequently lost her balance, rolling off the couch and falling bodily onto the floor. <nl> I took the opportunity to flee, quietly slipping out the front door. I lit a cigarette and walked down the empty street, pulling the red and gold scarf my mom had given me years ago close. <nl> I don't know why she kept doing it. Not the drinking; I knew why she drank. It was the fantasy, this idea that Hogwarts was real and that I was a witch. Obviously, I had figured it out years ago but my mother refused to admit the stories were just that, stories. <nl> Well, anyways, these days we would only get a few pages into the Order of the Phoenix before mom had downed two martinis and started to slur her words. <nl> I finished my cigarette and walked home. To my surprise my mother was upright and sitting at the table, with a cigarette of her own in one hand and a letter in the other. <nl> ""Look what an owl brought me,"" she said. Her eyes were red but alert. Her hand snaked out and grabbed my wrist, and she pulled me toward the letter. <nl> ""Open it!"" There was a hint of menace in her voice. <nl> The letter was an invitation to Hogwarts, done in my mother's crude hand writing. She hadn't even put effort into it. I couldn't help it; I teared up. Why did she do this to me?! <nl> Later that evening I could hear her laughing on the phone, ""she even started crying, the idiot! Tomorrow I'm taking her to Kings Cross. We are going to break the internet. This shits going viral."" <nl> That morning I went along with everything. I stood mutely while my mother dressed me in a kids halloween costume, not even a brand name but a cheap knock off, ""wizard boy cloak"". <nl> We got to the station and she pushed me towards Platform 9. <nl> I turned to her, hoping that she would realize that I was still her daughter and not her play thing, not a burden, but a girl who still loves her mom, despite the beatings and the drinking. <nl> She blew me an exaggerated kiss, pulled out her cell phone, and motioned me to get going. <nl> So I ran. I ran headlong at the pillar, because fuck it. Because at best I would jar my brain in just the right way and the last 13 years of my life would be forgotten, and who knows, maybe this would make my mother happy. <nl> As I got closer to the pillar I even started to believe that I was on my way to Hogwarts. That this was it. <nl> I could hear my mother laughing. I closed my eyes and braced for the impact. There was a roar in my ears. But I just kept running. <nl> ""Steady!!"" <nl> Firm hands gripped me. I looked up to see the kindly face of an elderly man in a peculiar set of robes. He had a long white beard and half moon spectacles. I looked around to see young people in black robes everywhere. <nl> The man looked down at me. <nl> ""We are so glad you've made it."" <eos>

She always went all out for things like this, even if it was just to humiliate me more.""<nl><nl> We got to the station and she pushed me towards Platform 9. <nl> I turned to her, hoping that she would realize that I was still her daughter and not her play thing, not a burden, but a girl who still loves her mom, despite the beatings and the drinking. <nl> She blew me an exaggerated kiss, pulled out her cell phone, and motioned me to get going. <nl> So I ran. I ran headlong at the pillar, because fuck it. Because at best I would jar my brain in just the right way and the last 13 years of my life would be forgotten, and who knows, maybe this would make my mother happy. <nl> As I got closer to the pillar I even started to believe that I was on my way to Hogwarts. That this was it. <nl> I could hear my mother laughing. I closed my eyes and braced for the impact. There was a roar in my ears. But I just kept running. <nl> ""Steady!!"" <nl> Firm hands gripped me. I looked up to see the kindly face of an elderly man in a peculiar set of robes. He had a long white beard and half moon spectacles. I looked around to see young people in black robes everywhere. <nl> The man looked down at me. <nl> ""We are so glad you've made it."" <eos>

"<sos> At first I thought it was weird they emphasized testing our sense of smell so much during the draft. It seemed that as soon as I mentioned being an anosmic to the attending physician a silent alarm went off in a distant room and my assigned role was already decided. <nl> I was assigned to a squad in the gardeners program, a program I've never heard of before. When you have your basic training you're taught not to question what you're told and just do what your commander says you should do. I was told our unit was in charge of highly classified testing of fast acting growth chemical designed to grow plants at speeds that will assure a sustainable future for the fast growing population of our country. We were to test this chemical in various test sites around the globe, to see how it handled the various climates and soil. We were the muscle behind this program, we were the ones with the canisters going between the rows of dirt and spraying the stuff for 24 hours a day. Our standard uniform was a thick white mask with a glass so dim you could barely see your own hands if you pressed them against the lens and a big black heat resistant suit. Due to the chemical being highly active we were told that under no circumstances we were to remove any part of our uniform and to never spray the stuff on another human being since it can mess with our body temperature. <nl> There was an old squad folklore about a guy who got the stuff on himself and suffered 3rd degrees burns all over his body, that's when they started with the heat resistant suit. <nl> We worked in shifts, three hours at a time, two shifts a day, always one person in the room to apply the chemical. Always in a distant building from the main base, always in big rooms with at least 4 rows of dirt. Thinking back, I've never seen the thing actually work. I mean, yeah, we were spraying it day and night everyday for a month at a time and still nothing sprouted. I thought it was just the chemical not working as intended. Some weird sciency stuff going wrong. But then, I tripped. It wasn't even that big of a fall but it was enough to push some dirt off the top layer of one of the rows. <nl> I saw a foot. <nl> I thought to myself that I must be imagining, or that some dirt got on my mask from the fall. I slowly removed the mask with a feeling of dread about what I'm about to uncover. The foot was still there. I dug a bit more and saw a little boy, maybe age 12 or 13, laying there, lifeless, in the pile of dirt, face down. I turned him over, revealing a bullet wound between the eyes and some burns around his neck. I was horrified, I started gasping for air, my head was scrambled, I couldn't think let alone stand. I hastily started digging, uncovering more bodies as I dug. Women, young men, children and elderly, all faced down, all dead, all with the same neck burns. There were 30 of them in that one row. I slowly stood up and realized there were 4 more rows in this room. The biggest room I had seen had 8 rows. All dead. <nl> A big thud was heard from outside and it knocked me back to my senses. I realized what I've seen and I had to hide the fact that I found out. I started covering the bodies as fast as I could, trying to distance myself from every face I have to turn back around. I put on my mask and I started burning the bodies. Every step I took I was thinking ""who are they? are they from the towns near the base or are they just random people the army wanted dead? If so why send them to remote locations like these? why use humans to burn them? is this I was assigned to the squad? because I won't be able to smell the burnt corpses?"". <nl> I finished burning the last row and I got out of the room. On my way back to my room I went past a mirror, still in my suit.

In those times, he got offended quite easily, and sometimes for no reason at all.

He was wise, fierce, and when he disliked something he didn't shut his maw. He was the most powerful asset in the kingdom's army too. <nl> And so passing my crown to him seemed like the best thing to do. <nl> That day everything was joy and cheers.

Six months of long hours talking about knitting projects for our cats, of comparing notes, failures and successes had led us to discover that we shared uncannily similar tastes. <nl> She'd been the one who'd suggested meeting up, though it'd also taken me about a week to agree. I'd met my ex-boyfriend through the internet as well, and it hadn't ended too well. After all, it was easier to distance your flaws from another if you never saw each other face to face. <nl> I was just pawing through my handbag to double-check if I'd brought the half-finished quilt I wanted to show her when she sent another text. ""Yellow jumper? We telepathic or what?"" she said. ""There in a jiffy!"" <nl> I grinned, then hailed a waiter for another menu. <nl> *** <nl> I hastened my steps as I drew close to the cafe RosesSmellLikeMe had chosen for our meeting. Sweat trickled down my brow, and I dashed a sleeve across my forehead. Briefly I wondered what she'd think of the stains. She'd always struck me as someone ... proper. Prim. No emojis, no typos, no shortened words. <nl> Then again, who knew what a person was really like in the real world? I almost giggled internally imagining if she was really a dude, masquerading as a woman just to get to know me. Not that I'd walk away though; unusual relationships were alluring to me. <nl> The cafe and its outdoor seats came into view, and I quickly scanned the scattered patrons for Nina. Nobody in yellow. Maybe she'd stepped out for a while? I called a waitress over, one who for some reason squinted curiously at me as if I'd sprouted a clown's nose. <nl> ""Is there a woman here in a yellow jumper, with a blue scarf?"" I peered over her head at the interior of the cafe, but couldn't see through the dark glass. <nl> ""Er ... you were sitting there?"" she said. <nl> I frowned. ""I just got here."" <nl> The waitress shook her head. Without answering further, she led me toward a table, which was quite clearly occupied. There was a cup of half-finished tea and a glass of water. A blue scarf was draped over the back of a chair. I nodded, relieved. <nl> ""This is the one, I think,"" I said. ""Thanks."" <nl> The waitress shrugged. ""Holler when you're ready to order."" <nl> I sat, eyeing the scarf. Had she gone to the washroom? I hoped she hadn't simply left because I was late ... <nl> ""Nice scarf ;)"" I texted. Then I caught the waitress whispering to a colleague, while they were both staring at me. I smiled at them, but inwardly wondered what was up with their rudeness. Had Nina done something to put them off? This was why I'd suggested a park initially, but I'd also wanted Nina to be someplace familiar to ease her nerves. <nl> Feeling a little irritated at the waitresses' behavior, I waved one of them over to take my order. <nl> *** <nl> ""Nice scarf,"" I muttered, wondering what the hell that was supposed to mean. I glanced around again, trying to see if she was hiding behind a tree and spying on me. Was this her idea of a joke? Perhaps I'd have seen the humor in it if she wasn't already twenty minutes late. <nl> A waitress came up to my table, carrying a tray. Then she set a coffee down in front of me. <nl> ""This isn't mine,"" I said. <nl> She sighed. ""Listen, my shift ends in about an hour, and whatever you think you're doing, it isn't funny."" <nl> ""But I didn't order this! Honestly, I'd remember!"" <nl> She scowled, hugging her tray to her chest. ""First you criticize me in front of everyone here for simply talking to my co-worker. Then you order a coffee, order me to go on a search for someone whom you've never met before in real life. Now you tell me you don't want your coffee. What the hell?"" <nl> My lips worked soundlessly for moments. I'd ... done that? Other patrons were shooting us furtive looks, which only seemed to confirm what she'd told me. The other wait staff were stopping whatever they were doing to watch. <nl> ""But I didn't do anything!"" <nl> The waitress made a frustrated noise and stormed away. Bewildered, I glanced at my phone, feeling more and more like this was just a bad idea. What if Maggie was simply a major troll, someone who regularly did this to fluster people? She wasn't exactly the most well-liked moderator either--her inconsistent behavior and tendency to get involved in flame wars would've gotten her kicked off the team if it hadn't been a subreddit she'd founded. <nl> I thought about texting her again, but my agitation got the better of me. Throwing a handful of bills onto the table, I snatched my scarf up and scuttled away, not even looking back when I heard a waitress call me. <nl> *** <nl> I'd just finished banning another troll on my subreddit when the waitress from earlier came up to me with a man in a dark jacket. <nl> ""Yeah?"" I said. <nl> ""Miss, you've been giving my workers a lot of problems,"" he said. <nl> ""Which wouldn't happen if they weren't so half-arsed with their service,"" I said. ""What're you gonna do? Chase me away? My coffee isn't even here yet."" <nl> The waitress snarled and pointed at the cup across the table. ""It's right there, you psycho!"" <nl> She was right; there was my cup of black, steaming gently in a pool of sunlight. ""I ... didn't notice."" <nl> ""Karen!"" the manager snapped. ""Go help Jill with inventory."" When she'd left, he turned to me and said, ""You're scaring them. This is the second time you've left and come back--"" <nl> ""What? I've been sitting here all this while!"" <nl> ""No, I definitely saw--"" <nl> ""Did Nina set this up? This a prank?"" God, I'd been hoping she wasn't just another stupid troll, out to cause trouble. I could've finished up my quilt at home, if I hadn't bothered to take the initiative to grow our friendship! <nl> ""Who's Nina?"" the manager said, but I'd heard enough. <nl> Grabbing my bag, I stood. Looking him in the eye, I said, ""You tell her I'm banning her the moment I get home."" <nl> Before I'd gone a few paces away from the cafe, the manager came running, clutching a blue scarf in his hand. ""You left this, Miss!"" <nl> I took the scarf, feeling the soft fabric between my fingers. Then I tossed it onto the pavement, stomped on it once, and stalked off. <nl> *** <nl> *Thanks for reading!

"<sos> Alex watched as the second sun collapsed over the distant horizon, dousing the walled city of Aspida in a goodnight glass of crimson wine. Beyond, and far below the wall he stood atop, on the craggy tundra of the Netherplanes, the unmoving, crucified silhouette of a titan rose high above the ten-thousand corpses surrounding it. <nl> A hand fell on Alex's shoulder: gentle and light and yet it still made him flinch and his stomach fall. When he turned to see Eleni standing there, her golden hair and white toga drenched in the red sunset, he had to hide his relief for fear she would see his nerves. <nl> ""You shouldn't be out,"" Alex said, although grateful that she was. ""The last sun is already failing."" <nl> ""I know, and yet,""--she smiled as she shrugged--""*here I am*."" <nl> Eleni moved past Alex, the skirt of her toga brushing his legs. She too looked down from Aspida's colossal wall onto the titan's body on the endless plane. ""He will be alive again, soon."" <nl> ""Yes,"" Alex replied, moving beside her. <nl> ""Only to be crucified again. Only to be eaten alive by those *creatures*."" <nl> It took Alex a moment to reply, his gaze distant. ""Yes."" <nl> ""Every moonrise. Can you imagine the pain he suffers? How is it fair -- how can the other Gods allow it? He only tried to help his children."" <nl> Alex sighed and lowered his head. ""Those that he tried to help, they weren't any God's children."" <nl> ""*He* believed they were -- it's why he went out there. We -- *mankind* -- are all his children. He sculpted us from the clay of the Earth. Stole fire from Zeus for us - he..."" <nl> ""I know what he did for us!"" Alex snapped, slamming his fists against the rough brick of the wall. ""You don't need to tell me. But *they*""--he pointed to the ocean of crucifixes in the distance--""weren't his children. They left the Gods, and when they did, they forfeit any right to be protected by them. They chose instead to pursue only the pleasures that the God's provided for them in the first place. They are traitors! Prometheus was a traitor, too -- to the Gods. To *us*."" Alex took a deep breath; his voice lowered as he became calm again, turning to almost a whisper. ""*He deserves his punishment*."" <nl> ""I know you don't believe that, Alex. Not truly."" Eleni turned away from the wall to face the long haired man who looked more pained now than he had ever done in life. ""There are many out there, they say. In camps much less than this, with no Gods to protect them. Not traitors without faces, but real *men, women and children*."" <nl> Alex sighed; his shoulders fell and the breath left his stomach, as if a gift taken back by the Gods. ""I know there are others. *Of course I do!*. But what can I do? The Gods think him a traitor -- if I help him, I become one too."" <nl> ""Then let us be traitors together!"" <nl> Alex put a finger to his lips. ""Hush! That is foolishness to say out-loud -- if we are heard..."" <nl> ""**Gods be damned!** -- they are not worth our prayers,"" Eleni spat. <nl> Alex strode to Eleni and put a hand over her mouth. ""Say such things again and we will both be killed!"" <nl> Eleni slowly pulled Alex's hand away from her lips. ""In life, you cowed before no man nor God. *Please*. At least speak to Epimetheus."" <nl> ""Epimetheus? He has no love for his brother -- or for me, for that matter! He loves only his precious animals. *They* are his children."" <nl> Eleni took both Alex's hands in her own. ""I don't think that's true -- it's just what he likes others to believe. Still waters run deep, Alex."" She pressed one of his olive skinned hands against her chest. <nl> Alex opened his mouth to respond. ""I-"" <nl> A gruff yell rang out from below. ""Alex, are you up there? Alex!"" <nl> Alex looked at Eleni for a moment; let his eyes meet hers and linger. Then, he broke away and called down to his friend. <nl> ""Yes, Idaeus! And Eleani is up here with me."" <nl> ""Well get your asses to the temple,"" Idaeus replied. ""The last sun is about to set and Dionysus wants to give a speech to put some courage into our apparently *cowardly* spines. And you know how long winded his rambles can be..."" <nl> ""Hah! Well, at least there'll be wine, brother. That's where the real courage comes from!"" <nl> ""Plenty of it too, I should hope!"" <nl> ""We'll be along shortly, Idaeus. Go ahead without us."" <nl> Alex waited until the sound of his friend's feet on the cobblestone path below, faded into silence. Then he leaned in towards Eleani, his mouth at her ear and whispered in a shaky voice. ""You are right. He was the best of us, and was the best of them. I will do it."" <nl> Eleni nodded. ""Will you speak to Epimetheus?"" she asked. <nl> ""Nay. I will do this alone. Tonight, while they have a skin-full to celebrate the start of the new moon, I will ride to the field of corpses. When the first moon hangs full, he will breathe again. That is my chance."" <nl> ""*Our* chance,"" Eleani corrected him. <nl> ""No! You can't come with me. The creatures may be wandering the plane by then, searching for their next meal."" <nl> ""Listen to me, Alex. I don't want to live here eternally, if it is without you. I'm coming too."" <nl> Alex clenched his jaw and was ready to object. *But...* he knew it would do no good. It never did. He sighed and let himself relax. ""If we leave -- even if we free him -- we can't return here. We'll be outcasts. Left to fend for ourselves."" <nl> ""Yes. But we will have done something worthwhile for once in our lives, besides drinking and feasting; besides worshipping deities who don't give a damn about us -- who only keep us for worship, and for the strength we give back to them."" <nl> For a while, they stood together in silence, holding hands, as the last drips of sunlight fell away, revealing the dark chalice beneath. <nl> ""They say,"" said Eleani, ""there are other cities out there. Other Gods. Perhaps we won't be so alone."" <nl> ""Perhaps,"" replied Alex. ""Perhaps Prometheus can lead us to such a place, if we succeed in saving him. Perhaps there are Gods more worthy of worship than our own, somewhere out there. And if not..."" he smiled forlornly at Eleani.  ""For now, come; we must at least make an appearance at the temple -- or Zeus help us both."" <eos>

Well, at least there'll be wine, brother. That's where the real courage comes from!"" <nl> ""Plenty of it too, I should hope!"" <nl> ""We'll be along shortly, Idaeus. Go ahead without us."" <nl> Alex waited until the sound of his friend's feet on the cobblestone path below, faded into silence. Then he leaned in towards Eleani, his mouth at her ear and whispered in a shaky voice. ""You are right. He was the best of us, and was the best of them. I will do it."" <nl> Eleni nodded. ""Will you speak to Epimetheus?"" she asked. <nl> ""Nay. I will do this alone. Tonight, while they have a skin-full to celebrate the start of the new moon, I will ride to the field of corpses. When the first moon hangs full, he will breathe again. That is my chance."" <nl> ""*Our* chance,"" Eleani corrected him. <nl> ""No! You can't come with me. The creatures may be wandering the plane by then, searching for their next meal."" <nl> ""Listen to me, Alex. I don't want to live here eternally, if it is without you. I'm coming too."" <nl> Alex clenched his jaw and was ready to object. *But...* he knew it would do no good. It never did. He sighed and let himself relax. ""If we leave -- even if we free him -- we can't return here. We'll be outcasts. Left to fend for ourselves."" <nl> ""Yes. But we will have done something worthwhile for once in our lives, besides drinking and feasting; besides worshipping deities who don't give a damn about us -- who only keep us for worship, and for the strength we give back to them."" <nl> For a while, they stood together in silence, holding hands, as the last drips of sunlight fell away, revealing the dark chalice beneath. <nl> ""They say,"" said Eleani, ""there are other cities out there. Other Gods. Perhaps we won't be so alone."" <nl> ""Perhaps,"" replied Alex. ""Perhaps Prometheus can lead us to such a place, if we succeed in saving him. Perhaps there are Gods more worthy of worship than our own, somewhere out there. And if not..."" he smiled forlornly at Eleani.  ""For now, come; we must at least make an appearance at the temple -- or Zeus help us both."" <eos>

"<sos> Usually he left the TV alone in the later hours. He wasn't really interested in following the more *private* details of his new friends' personal lives. Besides, he wouldn't even be home normally. Every day for the past two weeks he had been out partying and the channels hadn't been watched much - only a glance here and there to keep on top of things. He'd been able to prevent a few pranks on him as he had known what they were up to. They'd been getting a little suspicious of his clairvoyance and seemed to have dropped their attempts trying to trick him. And tonight, for the first time in a few weeks, Alex was home, completely alone. And he was bored out of his mind. <nl> He didn't really know what happened. They had all been making plans at Tim's place last night about seeing that new Marvel movie then heading into the city after. But when he woke up this morning he already saw two friends calling it off, and by the time he had dinner everyone had cancelled. He had reached out to a few of them in private whether they were interested in doing something, but they all had new plans. <nl> Alex had been wondering through the house trying to figure out what to do. Drinking alone was lame, he didn't have any fun games to play and the past year he didn't really develop any other hobbies than partying. After graduating high school he'd have the time of his life overseas in Europe and then came back for college, and he had dived right into it. He'd met a group of cool guys over the first few days and they had alright formed a tight group. <nl> Alex picked up the remote and zapped through the channels. *Boring, boring, boring, ads, ads*, he thought as he switched through them, until he arrived at 401. 401 was the first in the list of channels of personalized feeds. Every person he considered a friend would be listed from that point onwards, and right now he was watching through Jack's eyes. As he walked to the kitchen he glanced at the TV and thought he noticed something familiar, but it wasn't before he heard an echo from outside the house repeated on the TV before he turned suspicious. Still carrying a bag of vegetables he walked back to the living room and looked at the feed. <nl> He was looking at his own house. The patio, the wooden front door, the windows, everything fit. He only lived about 5 minutes away from college and his parents were almost always upstate, so at least he wouldn't have to explain why someone was sneaking up on his house. Alex hurried to the wall on his left and turned on the light in the living room. He ran back to the feed: the light had turned on. <nl> *The hell is going on here*, he thought. Curious he switched to 402, 403, and every channel he changed to was his own house from a different angle. And all of the angles had the same noticable black barrel in the corner of the screen. They were all carrying guns, and were sneaking closer and closer. He could hear faint whispers under their breath but he couldn't distinguish what they were saying. <nl> As soon as Alex figured out what was happening he sprinted upstairs, the bag with vegetables swinging in his hands. He wouldn't have any other use for the TV feed from this point onwards and he'd rather prepare for the fact they were about to storm his house. *The police?*, he thought, but dismissed it quickly. There was always the odd chance these idiots were pulling a prank on him and he wasn't really in the mood to explain some police officers as to why he called them for no proper reason. <nl> The wooden floorboards cracked from under his window. And then he slowly heard the handle turn and the door creaked open. He could hear them walk into the house. Another door creaked open. They had passed the hallway into the living room. Silently he turned off the lights in his room and walked over to his desk, hiding behind it. He heard sounds on the stairs. And then his bedroom door slowly opened. <nl> ""Aleeeexx"", he heard, ""where are youuuu?"" He guessed it was Danny as he could hear a faint grin through the attempted spookiness. Alex inhaled, counted to three and stood right up as he reached inside the grocery bag. With all his might he threw a tomato right towards the door. He heard a pleasing *thud* as someone yelled: ""What the hell was that?"" <nl> He had thrown three more tomatoes before they had spotted the direction he was throwing from, and he quickly hid behind the desk again as he heard *splats* and air pops a few feet away from him. ""You guys really suck at this, you know"", he taunted with a smile on his face. *Bunch of tools*, he thought. <nl> ""Look"", someone yelled back, ""at this point you should be happy if you leave with just a few bruises, you dick"". Alex rose up a little to see who had entered his room until red splashed over his head. ""Shit"", he muttered under his breath as he ducked again, ""that hurt"". <nl> ""Come out and play, Alex"", someone taunted back. <nl> ""Oh yeah, you want a piece of me, dumbass?"" Alex roared back as the shooting had stopped. He reached inside the bag and took the last piece of fruit in his hand, and as he flicked on the lights he rolled it towards the group. In front of him were his friends all covered in black suits with red stains, each carrying a paintball gun. And in the middle of them, on the floor, the pineapple Alex had just rolled towards them came to a halt. ""What's that even supposed to mean?"", Tim asked. <nl> ""That's a grenade"", Alex replied. ""That's right, losers. You guys lost. Again."" <eos>
","I mean, it's not like you guys win often anyway,"" Tim muttered under his breath as he rubbed his shoulder where a tomato had hit earlier.
