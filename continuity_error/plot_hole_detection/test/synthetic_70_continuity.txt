continuity 15
<sos> The riots are getting closer. Where they had once been a distant din, I could know hear the rhythmic chanting of their protest slogans. Prime Minister Basil had said that their protests were unfounded, but surely ignoring them wasn't working. Fires and looting followed in their wake, as it had for weeks. Surely there was *some* merit in their claims, if they were willing to go this far. <nl> I finger my prayer beads, watching as another building went up in flames. Another thing I'd always been told: our God would intervene. Our God would help. But nobody knew the last time God had even spoken to another, let alone intervened. <nl> Falling to my knees, I gaze up to the heavens through my window. "Dear God" I shout. <nl> And deep in my soul, I feel a snort, a stirring. An ineffable sound echoes through my head: "I'm awake! I'm awake! What did I miss?" <nl>I knew something was off," I thought to myself as I watched the chaos unfold before me. <nl><nl> "My Lord!" I cry. "The City burns! Rioters plague the city! Our leaders do nothing to stop it!" <nl> An invisible force picks me up, turns me around in the air. "Oh. It's you again. What happened this time...? Aw shit! It's all a wreck!" <nl> The force abandons me, leaving me sprawled on the ground as water erupts from the ground in massive geysers. The screams of the rioters resound through the air. Our God has stepped in! He will restore the world to what it was! Peace will reign! <nl> I hear the voice again: "Man, this went on too far. Knew I shouldn't have left things on..." The force picks me up again. "Figure I'll save you again, though. Don't know why I keep noticing problems when you're around." <nl> Beneath me, my apartment drops away into darkness, which spreads throughout the city and into the world. The cries of the rioters are lost in the wails of the people which are then consumed by the darkness. Eventually, even my body is lost as I feel my consciousness float away to... elsewhere. <nl> All of this because of me. Because of rioters wanting to restore ladders in their pools. <eos>
