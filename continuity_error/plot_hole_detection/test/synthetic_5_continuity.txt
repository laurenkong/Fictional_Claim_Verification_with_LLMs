<sos> "Here's your tea, here's mine," Abe says. <nl> He pushes an empty teacup towards me, takes one for himself. Bernie the Bear gets a teacup, too. Actually, never mind. <nl> "Where's Bernie?" Abe asks. <nl> "With your other toys, Abe," his mom says from the living room couch. She's uptight, snappy as a snob's fingers. Abe will grow to resent her, but it won't be for a while. For now, he thinks this is normal. <nl> "He's not," I tell Abe. "He's pooping." <nl> Only he can hear me, at least when I say these things. There's some sort of loudspeaker-- <nl> "Did you just fart, Abe?" his mom asks from the next room. <nl> "It wasn't me!" he says. "It was Gary." <nl> "Right. Gary." <nl> Poor kid. Nobody believes him. Hell, I wouldn't either. But it really was me who farted, not him. <nl> "If you have to poop, go poop," his mom yells. <nl> Yeah, no shit. That's what you're supposed to do. Good parenting, mom. <nl>Bernie isn't pooping, you little shit! I'll show you!" his mom yells, but Bernie's actually taking a bath with Abe in the next room.<nl><nl> "I can't," Abe says. "Gary said that Bernie's pooping right now." <nl> "Bernie isn't pooping, Abe," she snaps. <nl> She lights another cigarette. Wait, no. She doesn't smoke in the house, I just decided that. Power of being the narrator *and* the author. <nl> Sometimes she'll smoke one or two with her girl friends on a Friday night when she leaves Abe with a babysitter who goes along with the supposed make-believe and entertains the idea that there's somebody named Gary sitting across from him at the coffee table. <nl> But not today. <nl> She stomps into the room. "If you have to poop, poop!" she yells at Abe. <nl> Poor kid. I'll make things better for him some day. This is just character-building for now. It'll make him more well-rounded, give him some inner conflict, all that jazz. <nl> "I can't," he screams back. "Bernie is pooping, mom!" <nl> "Bernie isn't pooping, you little shit! I'll show you!" <nl> The bathroom door is closed. She doesn't even bother knocking as she drags Abe in by the ear. Poor Bernie. Just trying to take a teddy-bear dump and he gets interrupted by this lovely piece of work. <nl> "See, mom?" Abe says. Wrong thing to say, kid. I guess I made him say it, but still--wrong thing to say. <nl> Bernie is sitting on the toilet, right where I decided he'd be. The toilet is closed, but that's never kept a teddy-bear from pooping. <nl> Abe's mom doesn't care. She grabs Bernie and throws him in the empty bathtub. Opens the toilet. Points at it. <nl> "Poop, Abe! You're staying here until you poop!" <nl> Then she slams the door and leaves him in there. <nl> "Gary, why didn't you tell her I didn't have to poop? Now I'm in trouble," he says to me. <nl> Outside the bathroom, mom sighs. A long, mournful sigh. She thinks she has a troubled kid, talking to some imaginary friend so damn often. I can't blame her. He is a bit troubled. Doesn't listen. <nl> "I told you, Abe," I say. "I prefer coffee, not tea. Remember that and these things wouldn't happen." <nl> ***** <nl> Thanks for reading!
