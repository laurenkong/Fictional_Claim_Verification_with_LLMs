<sos> "Go ahead, boy," Dan said to his dog, Rocket. <nl> Rocket peered at the towering gold gateway in front of them. Clouds swirled overhead, the ground was a blanket of wooly velvet. Murmers and barks could be heard far off, beyond the gates. <nl> A large pale dog trainer, with golden hair and white robe held a silver, heavenly dog leash. The heavenly trainer held the collar of the leash out lovingly, beckoning Rocket. <nl> Rocket glanced at the collar, then back at Dan, unsure. He ran over to Dan and licked his face. The trainer stared at Dan knowingly, then nodded its head. He heard a voice in his head. *I see. Go, then. You may return soon.* <nl> Rocket wagged his tail, licking Dan's face and growling affectionately. The trainer waved as they left the gateway entrance. <nl> They walked down a silver staircase deep into the ground. Or was it a ceiling? Dan could not be sure. <nl> Dan followed the staircase deep into the depths of the structure. He held a handrail as he descended, watching Rocket as he trailed behind. <nl> From the air, out of nowhere, apparitions appeared. They had faces of grim death. One was a skeletal face, a snake weaving through its eye sockets. It spoke to Dan: <nl> *That one does not belong here. Leave it. Come with me if you want to be saved.* <nl> Dan looked at Rocket, and Rocket gave no indication of leaving or stopping. Dan shook his head at the apparition. "No," said Dan, "he comes with me." <nl> The apparition exploded into a red fireball and disappeared into the tunnel before him. Dan had reached a long corridor. At the end he heard screams. Bloodcurtling bellowing of men and women who were lost to the world. <nl> Dan knew he did not belong here. But it was the only way. And Rocket pushed him to continue. <nl> They moved down the corridor slowly, as the screaming grew louder. The walls seemed to shake, like when you go to a loud concert. That was what it sounded like to Dan, a loud rock concert of death. <nl> Rocket groaned, but they had come too far to turn back. <nl> They came upon a tall black door. A door as grim as hell. On the surface was a protruding eye. The eye opened and looked at Dan. It blinked a few times, then closed. Then the door swung open, and Dan and Rocket were met with a blast of hellish screams. <nl> The place was a spectacle. Humans being torn apart then put back together again, only to be torn apart once again. People on a spit, being roasted, eaten alive, then built back into full beings. Some people just cried in a fetal position. <nl> In the center of this huge arena-like place, was a tall tower. It had a glowing eye on top that seemed to oppressively watch all that transpired below. <nl> Rocket barked at the tower, and stood in front of Dan protectively. Dan patted Rocket on the head. "Its OK boy. They're just lost souls. We're not lost, we're on our way through." <nl> Rocket licked his hand, and they started to go through the arena, toward the tower. Large demons with scarred, tragic faces beckoned them to their torture areas. Dan tried to shield his eyes, to ignore the protests of the hungry wraiths. The demons of purgatory were hungry for young blood. They seemed to be attracted to Dan like a magnet. <nl> But Rocket growled and barked at the demons and devils as they approached, scaring them away. "Good boy," Dan said. <nl> As they got closer to the great tower with the eye, a dark cloaked being appeared from behind. <nl> "You do not belong in this realm," the being said. <nl> "Who are you?" asked Dan. <nl> "I am the keeper. I make sure people suffer in due course. I know the eyes of the guilty. Your eyes betray an innocence that transcends any purgatory. You have the look of an innocent. The are only two ways to go, up and down. Otherwise you stay in the middle, which is not where you belong." <nl> Dan shook his head in confusion, then pet Rocket. "Let's go boy, these people are crazy." <nl>Dan stood in front of the gateway. Nothing happened. He waited, fearful that he would be stuck here forever, waiting."#14
"Oh, I see. You can't handle the truth, can you?!<nl><nl> They continued their journey to the tower, stepping over dead bodies and severed limbs. The ground was caked with dry blood. The blood stuck to Dan's soles, leaving footsteps the color of wine behind him. <nl> They eventually reached the foot of the tower, then looked up at the eye. It beamed down at them. Searching. Scrutinizing. <nl> It appeared to be satisfied with Dan in some way. A doorway opened up in front of them. Dan and Rocket shrugged and walked through the door. <nl> Inside it was like a very old elevator. Like the type they have in bygone towers in New York City. Dan recalled a trip to the Big Apple when he was just a little lad. They brought him up to the top of the Empire State Building. When he went to the platform, he looked over the ledge, and dropped a penny. He was terrified it would fall on an innocent person's head and slice through their skull. <nl> He shuddered at that thought, and hoped it would not betray him in this place. <nl> Up the elevator went, seemingly forever. Just when he thought the ride would never end, they reached a top floor, and heard a *ding*. <nl> The doors slid open, and they were hit with a blast of heavenly white light. They heard choirs singing, bells chiming. There was a rainbow shimmer to the air. A dove flew over, and Rocket chased after it. <nl> Dan glanced at the dog chasing the bird, and laughed. <nl> Then he saw a giant gateway. It was towering, monumental, encrusted with jewels. He stepped up to it, staring up at the parapets above. It was a sort of castle, but the walls never seemed to end. Sort of like the great wall of china, but spectacularly stunning in form. <nl> Dan stood in front of the gateway. Nothing happened. He waited, fearful that he would be stuck here forever, waiting. <nl> Then a being made of light hovered down beside Dan. It had angel wings and carried a sword and shield. <nl> "Why do you have weapons?" asked Dan. <nl> "To guard against any invaders. Heaven is a place of protection." The angel glanced over at Rocket. "That is your animal. He has been your companion to this place." <nl> Dan nodded. <nl> "We welcome both of you to our home. Your home. Please enter, and be at peace," said the angel. <nl> Dan called Rocket, but when he looked over, rocket had changed. Rocket was a ghost now. A glowing, shimmering spirit. He gave a small bark, and licked Dan. <nl> When Dan looked at himself, he saw that he too was now a shimmering spirit. He touched Rocket, and felt the warmth of his soul pulsating within him. <nl> "You can feel each other's thoughts now," said the angel. <nl> Dan felt Rocket's thoughts. Pure love, that only a dog can produce. Rocket's eyes glowed, and seemed to cry with joy. <nl> "This is a good place," said Dan. <nl> "The best," said Rocket. <nl> Dan smiled. He loved happy endings. <eos>
