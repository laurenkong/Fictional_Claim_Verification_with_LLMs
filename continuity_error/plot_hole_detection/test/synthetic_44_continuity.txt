continuity 4
<sos> The creature first visited me on a long, lonely night, another sleepless, dreadful twilight  that I was spending brooding over the pointlessness of my existence. <nl> It crept into my house and swept me up off the couch with ease, gripping me tightly, my face inches away from rows of razor sharp teeth. <nl> '*This is it,*' I thought to myself. '*Finally...*' <nl> But the creature did not bite my head off, or rip me limb from limb; No, its long, cat-like tongue extended from its horrid mouth and scraped across my face -leaving me drenched in its rank saliva. <nl>Wait, you came back?" I asked, confused. "But you were here last night.<nl><nl> It let out a foul wail and released me from its grasp. "**Disgusting!**" It bellowed in a disappointing tone. <nl> "Sorry..." I was accustomed to apologizing, I've always had a way of ruining things up for folks. <nl> The creature left me soaked in my living room, and returned the following night for another attempt. Only this time, it had me eat a handful of herbs it pulled from a large pouch. They tasted bland, I never really had much of an appetite for anything. <nl> Again, the creature sampled my flesh with its tongue and again it was repulsed. <nl> And so, this began our nightly routine. The creature would return, feed me herbs and spices, sample the seasoning, and wail in disgust. I began to feel sorry that I continually disappointed the beast, and hoped one day it would find the right mixture of seasoning to end it all. <nl> Nearly a month of the creature's visits, and I'd come to anticipate its arrival. At this point in my life, this monster was the closest thing to a friend I had. <nl> But one night, the creature never arrived. I sat up waiting until the sun finally peaked over the hills, and I accepted the fact that the creature had given up on me -as everyone else in my life already had. <nl> However, to my surprise, the next night the creature returned! Oh, I felt such joy when I witnessed its massive form creep up from behind and into my vision. <nl> "I thought you'd moved on." I said with a faint smile. <nl> The creature examined me intently before speaking. "**Something different tonight...**" <nl> Without reaching into its bag of herbs and spices, the creature stuck out its tongue and sampled my face. I welcomed the warm embrace, like a hug from a friend I hadn't seen in ages, and, this time, the creature didn't withdraw in disgust. <nl> "**Hmmm, not bad!**" The creature nodded its massive head. "**Feeling better?**" <nl> I looked down at the floor, realizing that I was probably about to be eaten. "You came back; You didn't give up on me..." <nl> The creature paused, and I'm not sure, but I think I saw slight pools welling up in its eyes. <nl> It didn't eat me that night, or the next, or the night after that. It doesn't come every night now, but it stops by a few times a week and tastes my flesh. I'm not sure if it plans on eating me, but I know I can count on it being there -and that's enough for me. <nl> /r/BeagleTales <eos>
