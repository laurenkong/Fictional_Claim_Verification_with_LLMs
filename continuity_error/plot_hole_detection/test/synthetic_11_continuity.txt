<sos> "And in exchange for this power, I want one of your organs." The demon was smiling, it was pretty sure I'd take the offer impulsively. Dumbass. <nl> "Okay, but only non-essential organs, I don't want to die fifteen seconds after recieving these abilities." I was pretty sure I knew what was coming next. <nl> "Okay, I will take one non-essential organ from your personage. Do we have a de-" <nl> "Oh, and it has to be internal." I cut him off, this should hopefully surprise him enough to work in my favour, "After all, _skin_ is an organ, is it not? I don't particularly want to live without my skin. If it makes your life easier, I have a contract drawn up that covers all the unsavoury loopholes." I pass it the paper, smugness exuding from me. <nl>And it has to be my left kidney." I said nonchalantly, adding a seemingly random detail to throw off the demon's plans. <nl><nl> "And why would I sign this?" It said, "I see no benefit to me. Why don't I just leave?" <nl> "Your scare tactics won't work on me, I've done my homework. I know that if you return without having made a deal, you'll be punished for eternity." The colour drained from its face, apparently people don't ever think of making vague, accurate threats. <nl> "And if I sign this, I still get an organ?" He seemed worried, he really should be. <nl> "Absolutely" I reply, smiling my sincerest smile, "That's what was offered was it not?" <nl> The beast clicks it's fingers and vanishes in a puff off smoke. I wonder how he'll be treated after he realises he not only removed my appendix, but that I had appendicitis. What a win for humanity, free surgery _and_ the power to optionally never sleep again, but always feel well rested. Oh, and I hope he notices his new tattoo before anyone else, a demon of all things should learn to read the fine print. <eos>
