<sos> I leaned close into the guards ear, tightening my grip and pulling him in close. <nl> "Hello, this is Lockpicking Lawyer. I was put into a high security prison for nuking multiple major cities across the world. However, this high security prison cell door has an INEXCUSABLE design flaw. Here's how I'm going to open it with the zipper I broke off of my jumpsuit." <nl> I wound the long zipper again across my knuckles on both hands, and tightened the jagged metal strap across the guards neck. The guard gurgled, but that was OK. I didn't need him for long. <nl> "The flaw is you. My guard. All flaws start at people, and you are no exception. Now you are going to very, very slowly swipe your card to open my cell door, and then I'll let you go free. That's it. Nice and slow. No sudden moves, or I'll break you open, and see what makes you tick as well. I bet I could do it with a zip-tie." <nl>I glanced at my cheap digital watch to see how long it had taken me. Two minutes and thirty-six seconds. Not bad, but I could have done better. No matter. With a sudden jerk I broke the guards neck, and dropped the zipper back into my pocket. You never know when another lock needs to be opened, after all. And there were so many locks and people to break open out there. For so long I had restrained myself to locks, but now, I was going to see if I could crack open the world.<nl><nl> The guard fumbled at his belt and used swiped his card. It took him three tries with how hard his hands were shaking. After a moment, he got it, and the door popped open with a soft beep. <nl> Freedom.
