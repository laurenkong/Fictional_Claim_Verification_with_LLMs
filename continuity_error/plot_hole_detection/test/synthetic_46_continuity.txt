<sos> I was in complete shot when I saw her. Halfway across the world here I was, and in the shadows of the Eiffle Tower she reached up to take off her sunglasses. That's when I spotted that precious bare skin, like a gift sent down from heaven for me. <nl> "Pardone moi!" I screamed in my terrible, terrible French and rushed toward her, "Je suis... eh... Tu..." <nl> "It's okay, I'm American," she said back with a tone that betrayed nothing if not boredom, "What is it?" <nl> American! It wouldn't have mattered at all, of course, but knowing that she speaks my language, knows my world, it made the entire situation that much sweeter. To top it off, she was gorgeous, easily more gorgeous than any woman I'd seen in years. <nl> "Your wrist!" I immediately fumbled out, pointing toward her arm, "You don't have one either! I've never seen anyone else that didn't have it!" <nl>I reached for my phone to call her, realizing too late that I had forgotten it back at the hotel. <nl><nl> "Ha, good one," she shot back as she dismissively waved her arm toward my own wrist. Of course I was far too nervous, I should have told her that I draw mine on. <nl> "No, no!" I stuttered out, holding up my wrist, "This thing? This thing is--" <nl> "Fake, right? You draw it on? Or no, wait, it's a stamp? Yeah, yeah. I've heard 'em all." <nl> "What?" I said back, confused. <nl> "Listen bozo, you're not the first guy to try this, and I'm not interested. I'm not some one-night stand, you prick, and the fact that I'm destined to look around for anybody out there who may or may not exist doesn't have me too excited to play these stupid little pick-up games." <nl> "No! I promise you" I hurriedly yelled out, "Just look, I'll wash it off! Come with me, there's a cafe around the corner and watch me wash it off!" <nl> "Riiiight, cafe around the corner. You don't quit, do you? Well I do," she finished and briskly walked off. I tried to chase after, but in moments she flooded into a crowd and disappeared. <eos>
