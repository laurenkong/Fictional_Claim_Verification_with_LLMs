<sos> I always regretted the name. <nl>They said they would write it up as accidental, but we knew it for what it was. I was old enough to understand. It was like that until mom got sick."<nl><nl> I loved the rock, just hated the name. If you're going to be given a lifelong companion at the age of ten, I feel like you should be extended a do\-over on the name front at some point. But it is what it is. <nl> Rocky. Rocky the Rock Pet. <nl> Receiving your rock pet is a big deal. Granted, it doesn't take much to qualify as a big deal when you're ten, but I still remember the handoff with some affection. It was the day of my birthday and mom took me in the car downtown. Every town that had more than a few buildings had a certified Rock Handler. <nl> Our Rock Handler was Franklin, the nice man who tended the corner store. He had a rock that was just for me. It came in a little box with a bow on it. The tag read: "To: James Williams, From: US Department of Rocks." I remember carefully untying the ribbon and removing the top of the box. The rock was wrapped in some tissue paper and there was a paper with a bunch of instructions on it. <nl> "What are you gonna name it Jimmy?" Franklin asked. <nl> "Rocky," I replied, staring into the box in wonder. <nl> "You know how special Rocky is, right?" <nl> "Yes Mr. Donnelly, I know. He is going to be my friend and we're going to grow up together." <nl> "That's right. You take extra care with it, ok? You only get one because there is only one in the whole wide world for you." <nl> I nodded, and spoke into the box, my voice a whisper, "Don't worry Rocky. I'll aways protect you." <nl> My mom smiled at Franklin and then knelt down beside me. "I think Rocky is a great name. I still have Princess and she is one of my very best friends." She patted her pocket. "It will be exciting to see what both of you turn out to be." <nl> Once we were back in the house, I pulled Rocky out of the packaging and looked at him for the first time. He felt very heavy in my hand. He was white with little swirls of grey and shaped a bit like a brick. I memorized every little detail, knowing that he would change over time. I wondered what he would become. <nl> It was the happiest day of my life. <nl> Maybe its sad that receiving a rock meant so much to me, but I didn't have a lot to begin with. We weren't rich. Mom worked at the grocery as a checker and dad worked on the line at the manufacturing plant. We didn't go on trips, or out to eat, or any of the things people always seemed to be doing on the TV. There wasn't money for that. It was ok, food was on the table and I had two parents that loved me. <nl> I spent a lot of time alone. Dad worked the night shift and mom was working doubles a lot. But I had a pet rock. Every day I would sit with Rocky and tell him about the things happening in my life. Every night before bed, after mom gave me my kiss, I'd give Rocky an inspection to see if he had changed. <nl> He never did. <nl> My life changed though. A few years later the plant shut down. Dad said he didn't know how to do anything else but work the line, so he didn't do anything else. He was very angry. He drank. A lot. He wasn't nice when he drank. It just seemed to make him more angry. Sometimes that anger would be directed at me, but mostly he went after mom. <nl> I knew something was wrong, but it I didn't know how to fix it. Dad was broken. His rock was broken too. I saw it on the ground of the basement one day. It was black and split in two. He didn't know how to put himself back together. I think he wanted to, but maybe it just got harder every day and he lost the way back. <nl> I held mom a lot when she cried. I didn't cry. Not in front of her. <nl> I waited until it was quiet in the house and then I would crawl into the bed and would cry with Rocky in my hand. Every night I would look at him, hoping that he would change. That he would let me know that I was growing and becoming something different. That the future might be different than the present. <nl> But he was still the same. <nl> My life changed more. Got worse. There were fights now. Physical ones. Mom wasn't very big or strong so she lost a lot of the time. Sometimes I would try to push dad away. His eyes were wild, like an animal. He couldn't control himself any more. When he was sober, I could see the regret, but he couldn't figure out how to say sorry. To make it better. <nl> Mom said she should leave him, but she couldn't. She said she had made vows and that they meant something. I didn't understand why those words she said all of those years ago were more important to her than herself. But I was still young. So I was there to put her back together when he broke her apart. <nl> And then one day he was gone. <nl> He walked down to the basement and he never came back up. The police came by and made a report. They said it was alcohol poisoning. That he had drank enough to kill three men. They said they would write it up as accidental, but we knew it for what it was. I was old enough to understand. <nl> For all of the pain he had caused, mom still loved him. She wasn't the same after that. She smiled less. Her days were simply a routine that she followed to get to the next day. Men would float into her life and float back out without making an impression. Sometimes, she would tell me she blamed herself. That he killed himself to spare us. <nl> I don't know what I think about that. All I can think of when I think of dad was that black rock split into two on the basement floor. <nl> Rocky was still the same though. Not a swirl had changed. <nl> It was like that until mom got sick. Cancer. Maybe it was all of the cigarettes. I don't really know. She was so ill. She had nothing left to fight it off with. Life had hollowed her into a shell and cancer crumpled that shell.  She faded away.  She had given everything to me and I couldn't do anything to help her. Just sit beside her on the bed as she decayed. <nl> One night, as we sat quietly in the hospital, I pulled out Rocky. He looked just the same. As he always did.  I broke down into tears. <nl> "What's wrong honey?" Mom whispered, her voice thin and reedy. <nl> "He still looks exactly the same. Just like a rock." <nl> Mom smiled and patted me on the hand. "That makes sense Jimmy." <nl> "Why?" <nl> "Because you were always my rock." <nl> And then she was gone. <nl> r/PerilousPlatypus <eos>
