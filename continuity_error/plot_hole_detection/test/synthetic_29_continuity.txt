<sos> It all happened so fast. I was going into town for a shovel. Earlier that day I'd broken one digging a drain trench out behind the barn. <nl> Now I was sitting at a table in a room with a long mirror along the wall. The kind you see in a cop movie where they are shaking down a suspect. <nl>They found the body in the shed out behind the barn. He'd been dead for at least three days." <nl>  12<nl><nl> Oh fuck. I'm a suspect.  But for what. I barely leave the farm. <nl> "We can do this the easy way or the hard way", and middle aged man in a suit was entering the room . He had a briefcase and a tablet. Closely behind him was another man. He appeared to be some high ranking military officer. <nl> "Umm I really don't......." I was cut off. <nl> "Don't play dumb with us James. You have to know why you're here."   he was clearly annoyed with me. <nl> Then it hit me. Dad's brother Pete spends a lot of time up in the back corner of the farm at the edge of the forest and he always smells like weed. <nl> "That mother fucker! Listen, it was dad's brother. He's always up there. If you're looking for the weed he's the guy you want! "   My voice was starting to crack, I was scared as hell. <nl> "We don't care about the weed, we found that about an hour ago" The military man took the tablet from the suit. <nl> "It's the global calculated rankings son." he was swiping his finger over the screen.   "This showed up on the new rankings section at 8:43 this morning!" <nl> He slid the tablet across the table. A new page was displayed on the screen. Only one entry was on the list. <nl> \*\*New Category\*\* <nl> \*\*05/04/2019\*\* <nl> \*\*Most Extraterrestrial Invaders Killed Or Defeated\*\* <nl> 1. James Marshall   (1 Kill) <nl> &#x200B; <nl> &#x200B; <nl> The suit looked a little angry but now he mostly looked scared. <nl> "We just want some insight into what we might be up against" <nl> &#x200B; <nl> The only problem was. <nl> I had no idea. <nl> EDIT:  wow. I'm really blown away by the response to this. Thanks so much everyone. <nl> I really had intended to leave it at that but I do have an idea where it's going.  If I like where it goes I'll continue. <eos>
