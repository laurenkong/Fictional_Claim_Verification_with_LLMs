continuity 3
<sos> There is a trick to being an evil overlord. <nl> It's not the fact that your evil, or insane, or even smart. <nl> It's the proper amount of all three. <nl>I'd insert the following sentence at position 3: "But wait, wasn't the princess from the neighboring kingdom supposed to be a beautiful princess?<nl><nl> You must be evil, yes. But not so evil the entirety of the world rises against you. You have to be a bit insane to even consider it a good job to have. <nl> And being intelligent enough to figure out when and how to be evil? That's the part that very few of us get right. <nl> Now onto my current problem. <nl> After a long hard day of oppressing the masses, and the occasional beheadings of the few "hero's" who crop up every now and then. I was bored. <nl> And out of the blue i get a bard singing about the beautiful princess of the neighboring kingdom. <nl> Fantastic!! Nothing like a kidnapping to get the blood going I tell you! Especially when you road through halls full of guards. I was exceptionally proud of the "liberation". <nl> The knight getting nailed to the wall with his own sword was a nice touch I think. <nl> So, princess taken. <nl> And that's where my troubles began. <nl> You know, i thought i was evil. Like, i love me a roasted kitten every now and then. (never raw...) and don't forget the wine in the skull of mine enemies. <nl> This woman is batshit crazy. <nl> Like raw kitten kind of crazy. <nl> What's worse is she isn't the "I'll never marry you!! Never!" kind. She wants to get married. Like... Right away. Was hoping I'd find a priest when I'd kidnapped her. <nl> And she's already tried to poison me. Twice. <nl> I think it's true love to be honest. <eos>
