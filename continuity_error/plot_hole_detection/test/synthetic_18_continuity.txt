[lapse in the narrative]<nl><nl> UC: We are at 10 clicks, Fresh Air. Awaiting orders. <nl> FA: Copy that Ultra 6, continue your descent to 11 clicks. <nl> UC: Copy that. <nl> ******** <nl> > ##### Expedition Alpha Bravo - Unit 6 Encounter Debrief <nl> > ##### Private 1st Class - Martin Johansen - Page 2 <nl> ...continue our descent to 11 clicks. Commander Scott relayed the orders to our unit and we continued. Private Micheals and I connected the pre-laid communications line to a portable relay and began to un-spool new line as we went. We did a field test of the quick evac system and it was confirmed functional. <nl> Sergeant Mallorey manned the primary borer, which was ordered to the front of the of the line. It took about twenty minutes after receiving the order before we were on the move again. <nl> My suit's heat dispersal remained optimal, although we were seeing approximately one degree Celsius increases in temperature every 100 meters. We covered about 300 meters over the next six hours. Nothing abnormal occurred. <nl> At approximately 0420 hours, Sergeant Mallory hit an unmapped deposit of some kind. I think he said sapphire maybe, but something very hard. Forward progress halted and we requested a high density drill bit be sent down the tube. Fresh Air reported one was dispatched and would arrive in 33 hours. Commander Scott ordered us to make camp. <nl> ********** <nl> > ##### Transcript - 0910 Hours Day 2 - Expedition Alpha Bravo - Unit 6 Encounter <nl> UC: Fresh Air, do you copy? <nl> FA: Your coming in a little choppy Ultra 6, but we copy. <nl> UC: We're experiencing some turbulence down here Fresh Air. Anything to be worried about? <nl> FA: Nothing abnormal on the local scans, Ultra 6. Looks like a little belly ache, that's all. <nl> UC: Copy that Fresh Air - just wanted to confirm, put the gang at ease. <nl> FA: Copy that. <nl> ******** <nl> > ##### Expedition Alpha Bravo - Unit 6 Encounter Debrief <nl> > ##### Private 1st Class - Martin Johansen - Page 4 <nl> The new bit arrived at 1100 hours on day 3. We passed it forward towards the borer and Sergeant Mallory began the installation. In order to get to the drill head, he needed to back up the borer a couple of feet. He did so, but then became startled. Something about the mineral deposit shifting. I think he was concerned about a cave in. <nl> The Commander radioed up for a scan. Everything came back clean. .7 on the richter scale I think - but within normal ranges. Command gave the OK to drill, but the Commander and Mallory went to a private comm for a few minutes. When they got back to shared frequencies, Mallory switched out the bit. Took about an hour and then the Commander ordered us forward. <nl> ******** <nl> > ##### Transcript - 1206 Hours Day 3 - Expedition Alpha Bravo - Unit 6 Encounter <nl> UC: Fresh Air, resuming drilling. <nl> FA: Copy Ultra 6 <nl> [20 second of radio silence] <nl> UC: Cave in, cave in, retreating up the tube! <nl> FA: Negative Ultra 6, last scan came up clean, there's no... <nl> [Speakers overlap] <nl> UC: Everybody up tube!

Mallory's gone, the borer fell through. Negative copy Fresh Air... <nl> FC: Ultra 6, get up tube, there's a cavitation event occurring directly ahead of you. <nl> UC: ...move your asses! Fresh Air, requesting quick evac activation. <nl> FC: Activation approved, get your ass to the 10K marker. What are you seeing down there? <nl> UC: [unintelligible] <nl> FC: Negative copy Ultra 6, say again. <nl> [Audio Reconstruction Incomplete] <nl> UC: [unintelligible] towards [unintelligible] Mallo[ry] [unintelligible] saw bloo[d] [unintelligible] repeat [unintelligible] blood. <nl> FC: That's a negative copy Ultra 6, status... <nl> Unknown Transmission: **Saolamag@hnuansheeri.

The whole tunnel shook like crazy, and we could see the carbon fiber reinforcements start to buckle. I was at the back of the line. About 100 meters ahead I saw the lights on the borer just disappear, and we all heard Mallory screaming on the comms about blood and then nothing. <nl> I admit, I ran before the Commander gave the order. It's probably the only reason I'm alive today. Michaels waited and even the 20 seconds made all the difference. <nl> I ran up tube as fast as I could. It got dusty real fast, so I just kept my eyes on the neon comm line I'd been laying. I heard some back and forth over the radio, but I don't really remember any specifics. I was, not in control sir, I'm ashamed to say. <nl> It was around the 10 click marker that i heard the voice, if you could call it that. Same kind of thing from S1, only a lot louder. I could hear it *through* my helmet, not just on the radio. It made the earth shake. <nl> I kept running until i got to the the quick evac and hooked myself in. That's the first time I looked behind me and saw there was nobody there. Just darkness and that voice. The quick evac took 30 seconds or so to warm up and as it did, that's when it happened sir. The tunnel just fell away. I mean, like there was nothing under it. If I hadn't been hooked into the evac line, I'd fallen myself. <nl> That's when I saw the lights of the borer, and Mallory's helmet all lit up inside, moving around. It's hard to gauge the distance, but I'd say he was at least a click away, on the other side of this new cave. <nl> Then it started moving - the whole borer with Mallory in it. Not of its own power, but upwards, through the cave, like it was floating or something. <nl> I told Comm Sat this, i know it sounds crazy and I guess it was too dark for me to see for certain, but I swear, right before the evac kicked in, Mallory's lights disappeared and, well, you know how your hand looks when you stick a bright flashlight up to it in the dark? Well that's what I saw. Just giant, glowing fingers closing in on him, and that damned voice speaking over and over. <nl> Then the evac kicked in and dragged me up tube. Now, here I am. <nl> ******* <nl> ******* <nl> NOTE: So this turned into a continuation or companion vignette from another prompt I wrote earlier today. I really enjoyed writing the other prompt and this prompt was awesome too, and since I'd accidentally set up the other prompt's entry in such a way as to make it compatible with this one, I decided to continue the progression of the story and effectively meld the two prompts into the same universe as I was writing this. <nl> So basically [Part 1 Can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7vcgqg/wp_you_wake_up_in_the_middle_of_the_night_to/) <eos>
