continuity 64
<sos> When I died, I didn't really expect to be given a test. I mean, I was *dead*, you know? There's no need to add insult to injury and give me something that I had to fill out. <nl> "I really don't want to take this." <nl> The angel pauses in front of me, smiling kindly as she sets the test on my desk. <nl> "I know. We know that tests aren't your forte, but this is a Reincarnation Aptitude Test. It determines what you qualify for for your reincarnation experience." She winks at me before I glance down at the test and then back up at her. <nl> "I'm not going to try on this." <nl> "I know." <nl> She walks to the next person who obviously overheard our conversation. She explains quickly to the angel how excited she is to be reincarnated as a horse and dives into the test with a sort of vigor I will never know. As for myself, I do my best not to fall asleep as I circle questions randomly, sighing and writing down philosophical bullshit on the short answer sections. This is all not worth the three minutes of freefall I went through that led to my death. <nl> Always make sure your parachute works, kids. <nl> After I am done with the test (that was about two hundred questions too long), I turn it in to the strange lock box at the front of the room. The angel smiles at me and points across the room to another door. <nl> "You may wait in there for your results. Have a wonderful new life!" I manage a smile as I make my way across the room to the door. I open it to find another small waiting room where another man sits, rubbing his hands together. I realize there's another person in there too- a young girl -who is standing away from the man. <nl> I close the door and clear my throat awkwardly. <nl> "How long have you two been here?" I ask, trying to break the silence. <nl> "Five minutes." The little girl answers me with a small smile. It's tense. "How'd you die?" <nl> "Faulty parachute. You?" She shrugs. <nl> "Eh, turns out dads suck." I give her a sympathetic look and she waves me off. It's a strange action for a girl who looks as young as her- it makes me feel uneasy. "Hopefully I'll get another shot at it." <nl> "I hope so too." I say softly. "Hopefully this time with a less sucky dad." She laughs a little, still tense. <nl> "Fingers crossed." She replies. "What do you think you'll be reincarnated as?" <nl> "Probably a racoon." I say, causing her to giggle. "I guessed on everything." <nl> "I only guessed on two!" She claims proudly. "The one about-" <nl> "Quintin?" A voice suddenly sounds through the room, soft and delicate; the girl and I both look to the man in the corner as he stands abruptly. "You have been reincarnated as a Killer Whale. Prepare for rebirth." He nods, staring straight ahead. He doesn't acknowledge either of us when he suddenly poofs out of the room in a cloud of smoke. My eyes widen and my jaw drops. A silence passes between us, and I swallow thickly. <nl> "He wasn't very talkative." The little girl says, breaking the silence. "No fun." She wanders over to me and looks as though she's about to sit down when another voice rings through the space. <nl> "Astrid," this voice is different, more matter of fact, "you have qualified for another human life. Prepare for rebirth." She turns and grins at me, giving me a thumbs up. <nl>I glance down at my watch and realize I've been waiting for over a week.<nl><nl> "Dreams do come true." She winks. <nl> "Have fun." I say before she poofs out of the room in the same puff of smoke. <nl> I'm left alone, and I wait. And wait. And wait... and wait. <nl> People come in and poof away and yet I sit and wait. I wonder what is happening because, *hello*, I have been here for the whole day. I have watched people meltdown at their result, and I have watched people jump for joy- there have rarely been any in between. <nl> And then suddenly, it happens. <nl> "Oswald," I stand, three pairs of eyes turning towards me, "your results are extraordinary. Prepare for the divinity gathering." I make a face. <nl> "What?" I mutter, poofing out of the room. I yell involuntarily as my center of gravity shifts, my body feeling like it's being tossed and turned in mid-air. Without any warning I fall into a chair, the wind knocked out of my chest. <nl> I gasp for breath as something like energy flushes through my veins- It's like my body was given an adrenaline hike -and I shove myself up from the chair. I grasp at my chest as I am met with the edge of a table, using my free hand to brace myself- I end up splashing into some soup. <nl> "Gross!" I groan, shaking out my hand even as it trembles with the strange energy coursing through me. I look up at that moment to see a woman with bright crimson hair staring directly back at me, her mouth agape and bright brown eyes twinkling despite her shock. <nl> "What the hell." She says, standing up from her chair and tilting her head at me. All at once, I am struck by her beauty and I find myself blushing as she leans forward. "Another?" <nl> "Another?" I nearly scream as a man speaks. I whip to the side, finding an older gentleman; his long white hair reminds me of the stereotypical vision of God, and I look around the table to find several others staring back at me. <nl> "Another god!" The woman at the head of the table chirps. She stands as well, and I immediately notice her freckles and bright bubblegum hair. "It's been too long since we've had someone new join us, welcome!" <nl> "Uh... thank you." I somehow manage the words, although it feels like I'm speaking through cotton. "Where am I?" <nl> "In the Heavens." The head of the table speaks absently, others leaning over to each other and speaking in low tones. She moves onto her own question. "What may your powers be?" I shake my head. <nl> "I have no clue." I reply- wanting to tell them all that there's been some sort of mistake. There's no way I could qualify for divinity, there's absolutely no freaking way! This is all some massive prank that I am privy to- <nl> "-listening?." The woman across from me interrupts my train of thought. I feel myself flush again as she speaks. "Hold out your hands." I do as she instructs and she grabs my hands, pulling them towards her and shutting her eyes. I watch her, swallowing thickly before she suddenly smiles. <nl> "God of destruction." She says, all of the others breaking into their own conversations. I look to my hands when she releases them. I curl them into fists and turn them over to look at the backs of them. <nl> "Destruction?" I murmur. <nl> "It's funny." The woman at the head of the table says. "So far anything in the human world that's related to destruction has been of Angie's accord." The red head raises her hand so I know who she's referring to. "But now it's up to you..." She leaves it open for me to fill in. <nl> Despite everything leading up to this moment, all the confusion and all the doubt, I decide that even if this is a prank- I'm going to make the most out of it. <nl> In a way, me ending up here was a bit of a disaster. It's only fitting for me to be the god of destruction. <nl> "Oswald." I tell them. "It's nice to meet you." <eos>
