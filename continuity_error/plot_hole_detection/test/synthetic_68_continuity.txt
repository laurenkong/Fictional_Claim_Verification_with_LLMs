<sos> It's a tough business, working in wish-law; humans are such greedy, demanding creatures, always trying to suck every little bit of value from the Vault and into their meaningless little lives. More wealth than any one human could spend in three lifetimes, some kind of impossible superpower or immortality; basically, things that we genies can't grant. Sorry, we can't make your meaty fleshbag survive a walk on the sun. <nl> I swear, people think genies are some kind of magician and it kills me. My job is taking those impossible expectations, toning them down, and making them foolproof. After all, we genies get tired of being wish-slaves and screw with humans where we can. <nl> I've done it a few times in my day, before I was Free. <nl> But occasionally, you get a straggler, someone that wants to wish for something a bit off the typical course. Maybe healing a sick loved one, or furthering their career, sometimes even to help people. <nl> There are others, as well, even less pleasant. <nl> I was sitting in my office, reviewing my agenda, one Tuesday afternoon. Between two and three, I don't sit with clients, instead spending the time sorting out the following day. Secretaries be damned; I need to control my own schedule and make sure things are organized just the way I want. <nl> It was two-thirty when he burst into the door, followed by Regina. She apologized profusely, scolding the man, threatening to call security if he didn't leave. There was a fire burning in his eyes that captivated me, so I set my pen down and waved to her. <nl> "It's okay, Regina. I'll see him." <nl> She fired him a dirty look, then nodded to me and shut the door behind her. He took a seat before I could even offer, a rugged man, somewhat unkempt. <nl> "I finally found myself a wish. Huge pain in the ass, but I got it," he said, grinning. <nl> I blinked a few times, then smiled. "How wonderful. Is there something I can help you with?" <nl> "Yeah, no shit. I need to get my wish ready. You're supposedly good at that, right?" <nl>My jaw was slightly ajar. Can you believe that shit?"<nl><nl> My jaw knotted. "Yes, sir, that's what I do. Tell me a little bit about your situation." <nl> "Aite, so, my girlfriend Katja--" <nl> I tried to stifle the laugh, but just enough slipped through for him to notice. <nl> "Something funny, asshole?" He raised his eyebrows. <nl> "No, sorry sir." <nl> "Look, I'll take my business somewhere else. Plenty of people around making sure those wishbitches do their damn job right." <nl> The smile on my face faded. He may have just used that term because I appeared to be human, but the man's demeanor led me to believe he'd say it to a genie's face. "Please, sir, I apologize. Continue." <nl> "Well, my girlfriend left me last month. Bitch broke my VR kit just because I was flirting with some other girl. Nothing serious, just having some fun, but goddamn Katja is just so uptight. She just threw it out the window! Can you believe that shit? Women are insane." <nl> I held back any commentary on why women might be inclined to do such things to him. "So what would you like? To win her back?" <nl> He paused a moment, expression blank, then roared with laughter. "Jesus, no, you idiot. I want to ruin her life." <nl> I started. "I'm sorry?" <nl> "She's insanely afraid of bugs. Like, crazy scared of them. I want to wish a swarm of locusts on her, some real biblical shit like that." <nl> My jaw was slightly ajar. "Don't you think you'd be better off using that wish for something else, something to improve your own life?" <nl> He grimaced. "Nah, I wanna fuck that slut over. I can get another one, eventually, anyway. My dad has a lot of sway in this department." <nl> I shut my eyes a moment, then suddenly came alive. "Well, allow me to help you-- Mr...?" <nl> "Jordan Henderson." <nl> "Mr. Henderson." I pulled out a piece of parchment and a quill pen. "Let's begin." <nl> He frowned at my tools. "What is this old-fashioned shit?" <nl> "I prefer to write my work, as a sort of personal touch." <nl> "Whatever. Do your thing. Make it last a while, by the way. Make her really suffer." <nl> I bit my lip, thinking a moment, then scribbled a short passage onto the parchment. <nl> >I, Jordan Henderson, wish to have a plague of locusts, the insect, set upon my Katja in exactly 24 Earth hours from the time of placing this wish. It is to last 1,024 Earth hours and not affect any others nearby. <nl> He read it slowly, mouthing the words. "Why does it say 'my Katja' and not just her name? She's not mine anymore." <nl> "Ah, well, genies are tricky. In Egoran, their language, a name is meaningless as multiple people can have the same name. They refer to people in their lives with a relational modifier for specificity. You don't know another Katja, do you?" <nl> He shook his head. <nl> "Excellent. This will work perfectly, then, with no confusion. We specified it must be the insect and must happen in exactly one day, along with a precise duration, which won't allow the genie any leeway." <nl> "Why's it so short?" he asked, cocking his head at the paper. "I thought these things were supposed to be super long." <nl> "Ah, well, normally they would be. However, your wish is very simple. Most other people need multiple stipulations, after toning down their wish to something feasible, but this is very straightforward. A good wish, Mr. Henderson, very clean." <nl> He looked at the page and smiled. "Perfect. How much do I owe you?" <nl> I waved a hand. "Free of charge for an important client with an important purpose. It didn't take long, anyway-- just recommend me to your friends." <nl> "Damn right, my man, good to run into someone that gets it. Good shit. See ya around." <nl> Once the door shut behind him, I reclined in my chair and parted my lips into a wide smile, letting a little wisp of smoke trail out of my nose. I was concerned about who his father might be, but well, that was a problem for another day. Human men like him-- I've seen what they do to women they keep close by. And to call genies 'wishbitches'... <nl> But it's okay, because no woman would go near him for quite some time. That should help the world out, a little bit. <nl> Katja: slang for *kattjassen*. <nl> The Egoran word for 'penis'. <nl> ---- <nl> */r/resonatingfury* <eos>
