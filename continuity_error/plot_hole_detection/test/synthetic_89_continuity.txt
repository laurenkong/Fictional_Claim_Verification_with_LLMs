<sos> "I won't try to stop you taking whatever you want, but just so you know... everything always makes its way back soon enough," The shop owner said. A look of pity on her face. <nl> Darren raised an eyebrow, but kept the pistol aimed at her. He could hear the first wail of a siren in the distance. Was it for him? The woman hadn't moved since he'd drawn his weapon. <nl> "You might want to hurry," she said. <nl> The sirens grew louder as his grip on the pistol grew sweatier. His fingers felt hot against the metal as if he'd already fired it. His eyes darted around the store and then at the counter in front of him. <nl> He pointed down at the glass. "How much is that worth?" <nl> "It sells for fifty thousand, but to you it might as well be worthless." The woman slid open a compartment, taking her time. Her fingers found the diamond locket and pulled it from the felt display. <nl> Darren snatched it the moment it was above the counter. He let it dangle in front of him. The silver chain seemed to shine just as bright as the lights trapped inside the giant diamond. <nl> "Take it." she gestured to the door. "I won't stop you." <nl> The sirens were so loud. It sounded as if there were a squadron of police cruisers right behind him. He shoved the necklace into his pocket, a bit of chain stuck out, and then ran through the front door. On his way out he tucked the pistol in the back of his jeans. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ** *** ** <nl> Mariah watched the people pass over her turf. She held her cup out and rattled the coins inside. A few passersby shot her dirty looks, but most  of them ignored her. She preferred anger or disgust to apathy. At least they acknowledged her existence. <nl> "Change," she called out and shook her paper cup again. She'd gotten it last week when someone had tossed his half-finished drink on her. Though it had brought her close to tears, it also had the effect of making those on the street who'd witnessed it more generous. <nl> *I should see if I could get someone to pour their drinks on me more often*, Mariah thought. <nl> Today's haul so far was three quarters, ten dimes, two nickels, and a bunch of pennies she didn't want to bother counting. There was also the wad of gum that had been dropped by a snickering teen. Mariah had been pleasantly surprised to find that it had still contained a decent amount of its mint flavor as she'd popped it into her mouth. <nl> Her eyes caught a man shuffling down the street. He kept casting nervous glances over his shoulder. As there was nothing to be gained from a man so disturbed, Mariah began to look elsewhere. <nl> Something flashy caught her eye. <nl>His hands searched over her.<nl><nl> Sticking out of the man's pocket was a line of silver. It seemed to call out to her. She was no pickpocket--only ever tried it that one time. The idea of a repeat of her first attempt made her throat tighten up. <nl> She couldn't look away. Her tongue found its way to her lips as she slid it back and forth. <nl> When the man was close enough, she sprung forward. <nl> "Excuse me, sir." Mariah reached outwards, placing her hands on his chest. His eyes looked her up and down with an exaggerated grimace as if a rat had just jumped out of a dumpster and onto his leg. <nl> The man swung his arm into her shoulder and shoved her aside. Before she tumbled down, her hand found the length of chain. She tightened her dirty hand into a fist and pulled. <nl> She got it! <nl> Mariah hesitated for a moment as the diamond sparkled in front of her, dangling from her sticky fingers. She quickly stuffed it into her shirt. <nl> "You little..." the man's words turned guttural as he lifted her up off the sidewalk and threw her up against a storefront. "Where'd you put it?" <nl> His hands searched over her. <nl> "Help!" She shouted. "Someone please help me." Mariah tried to squirm out of his grasp as a hand traveled up her chest. <nl> The left side of her face exploded with pain. She hadn't even seen his fist coming. She was barely aware of the ground rising up as she fell. Somewhere nearby a woman was shouting, "Someone stop him! He's beating her!" <nl> Feet stomped and scratched the concrete around her. When Mariah looked up she saw the a crowd of men pushing her attacker back. The man's hands were still reaching for her. His eyes wild and bulding. Her cheek felt wet and warm. <nl> Mariah sat up and felt along her face. Her fingers came back bloody. She thought of the necklace and the world snapped back into focus with startling clarity. She still had it. She could feel the cold metal against her skin. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ---- <nl> Seymor waited in the alley. This was not his home, but he could count on the occasional meal here. Sometimes the woman spared a scrap for him. More often than not all she had was a scratch behind the ear and some kind words. It was more than he was used to. <nl> His paws padded against the shadowed concrete as he relieved himself against a dumpster. The smells that wafted from it and containers like this drove him mad with desire. <nl> A noise brought his attention away from the delicious aromas of the trash. <nl> The nice woman stumbled into the view between the two buildings at the edge of the alley. She didn't even see him as he waggled his tail and spun around a few times as she usually liked. No, her attention was on something else. Something shiny. <nl> She plopped herself down on her old mattress and stared at her hands. No, she stared at the shiny thing in her hands. As was he. <nl> "How much are you worth?" She asked. <nl> Seymor raised his ears. He was pretty sure people usually talked to each other, not things. He edged closer to the nice woman. His body tensed as he felt the need for caution. <nl> "Sorry, boy. No food today," she said without looking at him. Her voice sounded rough, almost angry. <nl> If he understood anything beyond the word 'food', it wouldn't have mattered. Seeing the shiny thing up close made his mouth water and tail shake more than the scents from the dumpster. <nl> "Why're you looking at me like that?" The woman asked. "Go on. Get!" <nl> She swatted at him, but he leapt back just in time. Seymor moved closer. When she swatted again, he took his chance. He ducked under her arm and closed his jaws around the shiny and darted away. The taste of metal and sweat filled his mouth. He had the shiny toy! <nl> He felt her fingers grasping, digging into his fur. Years on the streets, only bathing when there was a heavy downpour, his hair was greasy and hard to grab hold of. Seymor slipped right out. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ---- <nl> Prey. Far above the city's rooftops, she searched for prey. The wind blew through her feathers as she glided, her wings outstretched, hugging the air. <nl> The people sometimes dropped food, but nothing was as good a juicy mouse or... <nl> A sparkle on the ground caught her eye. She saw it bounce up and down as it was carried down a lonesome road. She swooped down for a closer look. <nl> Her shadow fell over the dogs back. She'd caught a closer glimpse of the dangling necklace. Oh how it sparkled. How it shone! Thoughts of prey turned to how she might decorate her nest. Though she'd built it years ago, she always had kept an eye out for things that caught the light. <nl> The dog looked up as she passed a second time. It growled, baring its cruel teeth up at her. She rose to the sky. The cool air up this high filled her lungs and made her feel invincible. The only though in her mind: shiny. <nl> This last dive was almost vertical. Her body whistled through the air. At the last second, the dog reared up on his hind legs and clawed at her. He made the mistake of snapping his jaws, trying to catch her neck. <nl> Through the dog's spittle and ruffle of feathers from his swinging paws, she managed to close her beak over the chain. The shiny. <nl> The dog raged below as she tore back to the sky with thoughts of where in her nest she'd place it. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ---- <nl> Samantha stepped outside and gazed into a near empty parking lot. Her store in this strip mall wasn't the last to close, but business usually tapered off quickly after seven. <nl> She heard the high pitched squeals and excited squawks from up high. <nl> *So soon?* She smiled. <nl> Back inside the store, Samantha moved behind the counter and pulled out a cardboard box. From it she snatched a roll of aluminum foil and tore off a small square. As she made her way back out the store, she crinkled it up into a small ball. <nl> Behind her building she climbed the ladder to the roof. From here she could see the setting sun in the west. Just enough light left in the day for one last transaction. <nl> The hawk watched her approach. It moved a wing to cover the diamond necklace it had started to embed in the fibers of its nest. <nl> "Mindy," Samantha said as she waggled the balled up aluminum foil. "Thank you for finding my necklace." <nl> The bird flapped its wings and screamed something only its kind understood. It moved its body over its treasure, guarding it. <nl> "Mindy." Her voice grew stern. She pulled out a flashlight and tossed the aluminum ball across the roof. Samantha watched as the hawk eyed the shiny metal foil skip across. <nl> When the light from the flashlight danced along the dozens of edges and creases of the foil, the hawk began to lurch out of its nest. <nl> "That's right, Mindy." Samantha inched over to the nest. "It's all yours. More shiny for your nest." <nl> Keeping her light on the foil, Samantha yanked the necklace out of the nest and back away. The bird would forget once it was out of sight and her new shiny was in her nest. She always did. <nl> Samantha walked back into her store and replaced the necklace. She breathed a sigh of relief and left her shop. <nl> Shiny things were the easiest to get back. Samantha was still waiting for the antique lamp to find its way back to her. As she started her car, she wondered where it was at this moment. What pair of hands had it passed over to today? It didn't matter. <nl> "Everything always makes its way back soon enough..." She smiled as she gave one last look at the shop and then drove off. <nl> &nbsp; <nl> ---- <nl> /r/StevenLee <eos>
