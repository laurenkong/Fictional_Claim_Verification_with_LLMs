<sos> Fluffmaster 3000 stretched his twelve teensy weensy jelly-bean toes towards the ceiling. His mouth yawned sumptiously. Two large, felt eyelids withdrew from his eyes. The big, black irises in their centers meant that he didn't have to *put on* puppy eyes to get what he wanted. Rather, he wore them naturally. This fact had brought him not only the affection of the humans, but also a comfortable shelter and as much food as he desired. Fluffmaster 3000 rolled over onto his fluffy paws. He was pink, squat, and about the size of a watermelon. A hind leg lifted itself off the ground and attempted to scratch its owner behind the ear. This attempt had to be aborted, however, because neither could the aforementioned extremity overcome the roundness of his belly, nor was his momentary three-leggedness doing any favors to his stability. The hind leg returned to the ground. Just in time, too, for Fluffmaster 3000 came dangerously close to toppling into the white rug's soft embrace. Quite an adventure. <nl> "Ooh, look who's woken up!" a doting voice said. "Who's a good boy!" it continued. The voice belonged to Vanessa Dimbright, or "V" as she liked to be called. On earth, she had been a social worker. Fed up with the low pay and little respect in broader society, she re-trained as a navigator and signed up for a mission to deep space. Now, she was still being paid a pittance and received just as little respect, but at least she had found a pet. <nl> V picked up Fluffmaster 3000 into her soft, gentle hands, and cradled all 15 lbs. of alien fat in her arms. <nl> Hard to believe that the creature was a member of a race of warmongering aliens that had ravaged the galaxy in search for -- well, frankly, they didn't really know. Turns out, they were all just very unhappy and decided to act out their unhappiness by looting and pillaging worlds across the Milky Way. This went on for aeons until, unbeknownst to them, an expedition of humans gave these murderous, fluffy delights precisely what they had wanted all along: a soft pillow to sleep on, three square meals a day, and enough cuddles to soften even Josef Stalin's stony heart. <nl>The makeshift electricity generator had been cobbled together with bits of wire and a half-empty energy cell. It hummed contentedly in the corner, supplying power to the consoles and lights. Suddenly, a loud beep signaled that the power was failing and the lights flickered ominously.<nl><nl> Fluffmaster 3000 snuffled into Vanessa's bosoms. <eos>
