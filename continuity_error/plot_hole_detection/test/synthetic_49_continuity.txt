<sos> "Calm down everyone!" yelled Silk, as he approached a bustling crowd surrounding the entrance to St Mary's train-station. He massaged his temples through his mask with a single index finger. Did the crowd have to be so freaking loud? It had been one of those day's at work -- one stress after another; he really wasn't in the mood for faux-heroics. <nl> He should have given Martin a call at lunchtime. Told him tonight was off. That's what he *should* have done. But he thought he'd be feeling better. Now what options did he have? Neither of them carried their phones when in costume (no pockets in their tights), so if he was going to calm this crowd down, he'd have to find Martin and 'pacify' him. <nl> In his left hand -- the one not massaging his head in an effort to stop it exploding -- he held a little brown bucket. <nl> "It's Silk!" shouted an onlooker. "Thank God it's you, Silk! Thank God!" <nl> He looked at the lady and tried to smile, but it turned instantly into a gaping yawn. "Is... Is it Beat-Hooven again?" he asked lazily. <nl> "Yes! He's on the train. And he's got a whole lot of hostages. I think he's going to kill them!" <nl> Silk stuck out his tongue and bit down. "Difficult situation. Very tricky. But, I'll see what I can do." He placed the bucket down where he was standing and gave his usual speech-cum-terms-and-conditions. "Thank you all for being here tonight to help me. Through your cheering and positivity I will not just battle my oldest and gravest foe, but I will defeat him!" He lowered his voice slightly and could feel his cheeks redden. "*If you'd like to support me outside of these situations, please consider leaving a donation in the bucket here. It's easy being a hero -- it's not easy paying rent in a city like this. And as for the medical expenses...*" <nl> And with that, he began wading through the crowd. Hands pawed at him, trying to touch the hero, to encourage him. But it only slowed him. Irritated him. Like being in quicksand, he thought-grumbled. <nl> Only a few of his most ardent supporters followed him into the station -- most people's joy at seeing their idol was trumped by the fear of mortal danger. And even those few had scattered by the time he'd climbed the steps and made it to the tracks. On them, was a long iron monster, belching and rocking. All windows and doors were closed, but he could see pale faces inside that had turned to look at him, pressed against the glass. <nl> He raised his hands to his mouth and yelled, "Beat-Hooven! It is I, *Silk*. Your battle is with me, not the innocent passengers of that train! Let them go and come out and face me, mano-a-mano!" <nl> Moments passed. Minutes. Martin, he thought in annoyance, will you please stop showboating. I'm not in the mood. I just want to get home and play a little playstation, eat a little pizza, and say goodnight to this shitty day. <nl> Finally, the train hissed and the doors opened. <nl> Passengers scuttled out from it as if a dam had been opened. They mostly thanked him as they passed and wished him good luck. <nl> "Donation bucket is outside the station!" he said. He noticed most of the men and women were in business suits. Good train to hijack, he thought. At least Martin had got that right -- we should easily get a enough for a pizza or two. <nl>He looked at the lady and tried to smile, but it turned instantly into a gaping yawn."<nl><nl> Music trickled out from the train. A soft sonata. Silk let himself relax, let his posture slouch, as he drifted into the music. <nl> He was just starting to feel somewhat calm, when Beat-Hooven jumped off the train. <nl> "Silk!" he screamed maniacally. "Prepare for a crescendo! You shall become my most famous requiem!" <nl> Silk glanced around him. No passengers had stayed. Good. He turned back to Martin. "Cut it out, Mart. My head is about to explode, I swear." <nl> Beat-Hooven glared at him and whispered, "Stay in character, idiot. Besides, blowing up isn't your power." <nl> "There's no one here. So relax. And I know it's not my power, but I've got a pretty nasty migraine and--" <nl> "Oh please," Martin said, rolling his eyes. "A headache. That's what you've got. If you had a migraine you'd be chucking up in a gutter right now. You've no idea how bad they are." <nl> "Whatever. My head hurts. Can we just go?" <nl> "Go?" Martin looked annoyed. "What about the spectacle? The show?" He held out a hand and poked Silk in his chest. "What about all the carefully choreographed heroics we've been practising night after night, hour after--ouch!" <nl> Silk had grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back. <nl> "Let me go! That frikking hurts, idiot." <nl> "We're going home. Now. I'm going to march you like this out of the station, so people can see that I defeated you, and we can maybe rustle up a few more donations. Then, we're off. I'll fly you to 'jail' or something." <nl> Martin grumbled as Silk pushed him back into the station, down the stairs, and back out into the street. <nl> "What..." Silk said in surprise. <nl> Martin let out a stifled laugh. <nl> "What..." Silk repeated. No one was there. No crowd. No bucket. Someone had taken their donation bucket! Well that was just great! Wait, not no one. One young boy was standing there, back against the wall. <nl> "Hey! Kid!" Silk cried out. "Where'd everyone go?" <nl> The boy turned to him. "Oh. NightRaven showed up on 4th street threatening to blow up the block. Word is Eve is heading there to confront her." <nl> Silk let out a weary sigh. He couldn't believe Janette and Claudia would do this on one of *their* nights -- again!. They'd agreed to the timetable! He'd go over to their apartment tomorrow and give them a piece of his mind. And right now, his mind wasn't very peaceful. <nl> He said to the kid, "And why aren't you there watching them? The 'hottest' hero and villain pairing in the city. That no other duo -- no matter their long and incredibly exciting history -- can match, apparently." <nl> The kid shrugged. "Don't like superheroes anymore. Seen it all before." <nl> Silk sighed and released his hold on Martin. "I'm starting to feel the same way." <nl> Martin, for some reason, was grinning.  He placed his arm around Silk's shoulders. "Ah, shit happens, pal. Don't let it get to you." <nl> "Shit does happen," he agreed. "It truly does." <nl> "Come on, I'll buy the pizza." <eos>
