<sos> The first thing to hit Cooper's senses when he first stepped into the top-floor office of Stellar Consulting was the smell of dirt. <nl> It seemed nobody had warned him about it during the interview with two of the firm's top partners, in a cafe down the office block two months ago. To be honest, it'd been so long ago that he couldn't even remember whether anyone had brought it up. <nl> Not a big deal, he thought. He'd get used to it. That was why he'd quit his job and spent a year traveling the world. Getting used to new things. Seeing new culture, and all that. Exposure. Employers loved hearing about that, and his interviewers had certainly perked up and excitedly jabbered about picking his brains on all the things he'd seen. <nl> But he couldn't help feeling a bit disturbed at the sight of his co-workers' desks as the HR lady showed him around the office. They were covered in ... soil. Freshly turned soil, it seemed, brown as coffee residue. And on each desk, creeper plants curled around jars of stationery and stacks of paper. <nl> Also, there were bean bags everywhere, in all colors. He had to climb over a small hill of them just to get through a corridor, though the HR lady did so with an unusual display of agility and poise. The meeting rooms were tastefully decorated--lots of steel and frosted glass--but almost every surface of the walls and glass were covered with Post-its. Some looked blank. <nl> Strange, but not the strangest he'd seen during his travels. <nl> "You'll sit here," the nice HR lady said. They were all nice; every single one of the forty or so employees had seemingly permanent smiles etched on their faces. He tried smiling back to hide the slight dismay he felt upon seeing his earthy worktable. A fine, crusty layer covered his keyboard, and a curtain of leaves was hiding his monitor. <nl> "Er, do you guys mind if I, uh, get rid of the plants?" he said, gesturing at his computer. <nl> The HR lady--Kaarren, or so the badge clipped to her lapel claimed--smiled even wider. "Of course!" <nl> He nodded and eased himself into the chair, which was fortunately clean. The moment his butt hit the foam, the entire office erupted into applause, causing him to jump. Blushing furiously, he sank into his chair. <nl> A throat being cleared made him turn his head and regard the source. His neighbor was a bald, middle-aged man wearing a shirt so white it was almost blinding. He, Cooper noted, was most certainly not smiling. <nl> "Welcome," the man said, sounding weary as he typed on his keyboard without looking at Cooper. That was when Cooper realized the man's desk was completely devoid of dirt. Not a single speck. <nl> "My name is Cooper. Pleased to meet you," he said politely. <nl> The man grunted. "Name's Michael. When you've got your coffee, I'm supposed to show you 'round some of our systems. Boot your computer and let's get ready to rumble." <nl> Cooper nodded, admiring the fellow--he was the eye of normalcy in a hurricane of strangeness. Resolving to make this man his best friend, Cooper grabbed a mug from his desk and headed for the pantry. <nl>Oh, great Constellations," Arrnoldd muttered to himself. <nl><nl> *** <nl> About half an hour later, Cooper returned to his desk with a mug of boiling water. Despite his hopes, Michael noticed and snorted. <nl> "Take it you didn't know how to use the mortar and pestle to grind the beans," he said. <nl> Cooper nodded. "It's okay. I don't really like coffee, anyway. It's too acidic for me." <nl> Michael shrugged. "Whatever. You can ask Harreyy to help you out. He's that guy there--yeah, he's seen us staring, he's waving, oh how nice, wave back, that's right--okay, forget him, let's get started." <nl> "Have you been here ... long?" Cooper said, a little timidly. <nl> "Two years," Michael said. He grinned as he followed Cooper's gaze to his desk. "Dumped the lot onto the floor on my first day. Ain't putting up with their shit." <nl> "They're ... weird," Cooper said. <nl> Michael stared at Cooper and stroked his chin. "Hm ... could you be ... never mind. Yeah, but you'll get used to it. These folks don't mean any harm. They can be fun too, you know. Every Tuesday, the bosses order beer by the keg, and lots of calamari. Not sure why, but it's culture, they say. And on Fridays, they--well, you'll see." He flashed Cooper a wicked grin. <nl> "What?" <nl> "Guess you don't like surprises, huh. Let's just say we get rather entertaining dancers to liven things up." Michael punched Cooper lightly on the arm, causing him to wince. <nl> Seemingly not noticing, Michael said, "Alright, let's begin. Here, open up this program ..." <nl> *** <nl> After his first toilet break, Cooper resolved to look for another one. This was a whole new level of weird--the toilet was simple a horizontal hole in the wall, waist-high. He simply couldn't hit the target and had to expand half a toilet roll to clean the mess up. <nl> He said nothing to Michael--if he wanted Michael to be his friend, he had to stop embarrassing himself in front of him. So he buried himself in his work, trying to ignore how his elbows kept sinking into the soil. <nl> The moment five o'clock arrived, every single employee in the place stood up and began packing their things away, seemingly in unison. Even Michael did it, though with slower and more wearisome motions. <nl> "That's punctual," he said. <nl> Michael flashed him a grin. "Hey, don't be the nail that sticks up, right? See you tomorrow." <nl> Before long, the only person left was Cooper. He leaned back in his chair and rubbed his temples. God, what a day. The toilet was a nightmare--he'd have to find some way to hold it in. Feeling peckish, he headed to the pantry again. <nl> The cabinets held little else but coffee beans. The water cooler bubbled merrily in the corner as he searched under the sink. There were several packets of hot dog buns, with nothing in the way of fillings or condiments. Maybe those were for parties. He decided not to eat them. <nl> He was rifling through a fridge filled with what looked like jars of jelly when someone coughed behind him. He yelped and turned to find Arrnoldd, the managing director, watching him. <nl> "Sir," he barked. <nl> Arrnoldd gave him a quizzical look. "Still here, are you? Well, pack your things. I'm heading home. Everyone heads home at five, yes?" <nl> "Uh ... yes," Cooper said. The day's memories, from the bean bags to the toilet to the dirt-tables, came rushing to the forefront of Cooper's brain, and before he could stop himself, he said, "Everything's so weird here." <nl> Arrnoldd went almost completely still. Even the wispy hair on the top of his head seemed to have frozen solid. "Weird ...?" <nl> With a nervous laugh, Cooper rambled about the office and his co-workers. With every word, he thought the managing director was becoming more and more nervous. <nl> "So, yeah. Just my feeling, but I like it here. Everyone's nice. Michael too. But he's ... different." <nl> "Yes," Arrnoldd said. <nl> "It's almost like you're all aliens, and he's a human, but that can't be, right?" Cooper chortled, mostly to himself. <nl> Almost imperceptibly, Arrnoldd's left eye twitched. If Cooper hadn't had to pay attention to the tics of various peoples worldwide, he wouldn't have noticed. "Very strange," Arrnoldd agreed cautiously. <nl> "Why, the dirt, and the toilet hole thing, almost makes me think you're Bxxghtli," Cooper said. <nl> Arrnoldd sputtered. "What? How did you--oh, great Constellations." <nl> Cooper clamped a hand over his forehead, horrified. "So it's true? You're all aliens, and Michael's human?" <nl> "Who cares about that! You're an alien too! What are you doing here?" <nl> Cooper shrugged. "I come in peace. I just want a job. But I don't like the dirt." <nl> "We'll have it removed for you," Arrnoldd said. Green spots were beginning to appear on his skin--Cooper knew they signified relief. "Jeez, and I was thinking we'd hired two humans." <nl> Cooper frowned. "Why?" <nl> "We thought we were studying humans in this office, but it turned out that we were studying aliens imitating humans. Imitating them pretty badly too, I have to say." Arrnoldd looked wistfully at the human's desk. "It's a pity, because we really like working with one another. And then we accidentally hired him. In case you haven't noticed, he's a bad fit. It's not good for our corporate image." <nl> "Shit," Cooper said. "So fire him." <nl> "But that's the thing," Arrnoldd said sadly. "We haven't learned how to deal with the fallout from terminating an employee." <nl> *** <nl> *Thanks for reading!
