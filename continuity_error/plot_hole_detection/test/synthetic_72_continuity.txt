continuity 16
<sos> Elena was a matryoshka painter.  At sunset, the woodworker Anatoly would knock on the apartment door with his wheelbarrow beside him.  Anatoly would give Elena all the plain figurines that he had carved that day, curving the balsam wood into the prospect of a head, shoulders and torso, then cutting the doll at her waist so that her legs would twist off, and hide her secrets.  Elena would pay Anatoly five hundred rubles for each full matryoshka and then she would go to her workshop (which was in fact only just the corner of her father's kitchen behind the stove) and she would paint the wood into beautiful women. <nl> Elena would paint the women with long eyelashes and blushing cheeks, and Elena would wonder what it would feel like to blush and flutter her own eyes, if ever a kind and handsome man were to pour vodka into a glass, and hand it to her, letting his fingertips pass over hers.  She would paint the women wearing elegant dresses adorned with tulips and roses, and Elena would imagine sewing an elegant silk dress to wear herself.  She would give the woman full-hearted smiles, and Elena would try to remember the last time she had smiled, apart from when she meant to attract the customers to her booth at the Udelnaya.  And then she would paint the next doll nested within, more intricately, but otherwise the same.  However, at their core, Elena's matryoshka contained a protest: open her dolls up to the final girl, the smallest and deepest girl of all, and you will find that she is not smiling or blushing, but instead has short eyelashes and a stern gaze. She wears only a plain grey dress.  For though Elena painted matryoshka, she had never known her own mother, and therefore knew that not all daughters will inherit. <nl> In the morning, Elena would pack her matryoshka in a box and take the bus to the Udelnaya, hoping to sell her work.  Most days, she would be lucky to sell two or three matryoshka.  But there was one day when she sold none at all, yet left the Udelnaya joyful. On that day, a certain tall man in a white dress shirt had come to the market.  There, he saw Elena at her booth with the shelves of matryoshka behind her, all red and green, gold and blue, and the man was enamored. <nl>The man gave Elena a piece of paper with directions to an elegant restaurant on the banks of the Moyka River. He gave her his credit card as well, and told her that were she to go buy a nice dress, that he would be honored to see her in it, and dine with her that evening. Elena was overjoyed, and as she stepped outside, she hailed a cab to take her to the boutique. <nl><nl> "I have never seen a woman who I am more certain has a secret hiding inside her," the man said to Elena.  He was wearing a gold watch and many silver rings.  Elena told him that he could buy as many matryoshka as he wished, and discover everything within them.  But then the man said the woman he meant to describe was not any of the matryoshka, but Elena herself. <nl> The man gave Elena a piece of paper with directions to an elegant restaurant on the banks of the Moyka River. He he gave her his credit card as well.  He told Elena that were she to go buy a nice dress, that he would be honored to see her in it, and dine with her that evening.  Elena blushed, and then she smiled, even though she had not sold a matryoshka. <nl> That evening, instead of painting, Elena went to the best boutique in St Petersburg, and she bought a beautiful silk dress.  She then met the man at the appointed restaurant.  He spread caviar onto crackers for her, and poured her some vodka.  He asked her about her life, how many matryoshka she supposed she had painted, and if any were very special to her.  But, as the meal continued, Elena began to feel more and more confused and dizzy, until everything became terribly blurry.  When Elena awoke, she was no longer in the restaurant or in the small bed beside her father's.  She was standing upright, but frozen in pose, perched on a gold podium in a white expanse, more still and desolate than the Tauride Gardens after the first snowfall.  Elena was lined up neatly between a hundred other young women, all immobile as well. <nl> "Where am I" Elena asked, "who are you all?" <nl> "That man who gave you a dress and dinner," the young woman beside her explained, "was not in truth a man, but the wicked god of Motherless Girls.  He keeps us here as figurines, upon his shelf for all eternity.  He tells us that long ago, he once loved a goddess called Anna, who also had no mother, who was the First Woman, and that we remind him of her.  When Anna birthed their child, the girl was mortal.  So the god sought to kill the child as an abomination.  But Anna loved the baby, so she fled the heavens to the Barsky taiga.  The god chased her all through the trees, but Anna refused to return, and at last a bargain was struck: she would remain in the Barsky with her daughter, but thereafter Anna would become mortal as well.  But, if any of her descendants to ever live without a mother, the god would be entitled to reclaim those girls and bring them here, to remain forever in his collection." <nl> Elena was crestfallen at the thought of never again seeing her father or St Petersburg, and of being frozen in place.  She screamed out to the god of Motherless Girls and demanded to be freed.  But the god just laughed, all throughout his menagerie. <nl> But then, after many days of considering her plight, Elena formed a plan.  "Allow me to turn your collection into matryoshka!," she called out to the god, "Let me separate each of these women into pieces, into clear layers, so that you might consider each part of her more easily, and find what it is in each of us that resembles your beloved Anna!" <nl> Elena's proposal thrilled the god, for even after all his abductions, he was still no closer to grasping what it was that makes a motherless woman so special, so like the First Woman.  He released Elena's muscles and demanded that she go to work at once, separating and straining each of his women into a partwise matryoshka. <nl> From where the god watched, it appeared to him Elena was doing as she had promised.  But each time his back was turned, or when Elena carefully angled her subject and stood nose to nose, she would reach inside the girl, and she would pull forth her soul, which lives in her deepest layer.  Elena would hide the soul in her bosom until she could move on and quietly feed it to another girl, until every girl had taken in the soul of one of her fellow captives.  Finally, Elena pulled out her own soul and fed it to the woman whom she had been first placed beside.  At last, each captive woman had taken in the soul of another, thereby promising to care for it and nurture it.  Because of this, the women of the menagerie had all become mothers to each other, and were no longer in thrall to the selfish god. <nl> The god saw that Elena was no longer hard at work, so he returned to inspect her progress.  But as he entered the menagerie, all the captives suddenly broke from their poses.  All together, they hit and kicked the god, until he fled.  The menagerie with all its gold podiums vanished, and the girls fell through a void, until everything again became blurry. Elena awoke in her small bed in her father's apartment in St Petersburg. <nl> That night, Anatoly came at sunset with the blank wood for Elena.  For the first time, she did not paint the final doll with a stern face and grey dress.  For now, Elena knew that somewhere there was a woman who would always carry her soul, always nurture and protect it, and that this meant she would always have a mother to inherit from. <eos>
