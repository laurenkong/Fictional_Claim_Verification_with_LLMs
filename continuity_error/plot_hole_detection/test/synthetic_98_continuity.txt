<sos> Down below her, she could hear the bells ringing in the town. She knew she was desperate, coming here, but up in the mountains, gold was getting scarce. All the bigger and older dragons had massive hoards, and trying to wrest a single, ancient coin away from the other dragons was liable to wind up with her getting soundly beat. There were no more ancient barrows or lost temples up in the mountains that hadn't been picked clean by the other dragons. A lot of the younger ones had come down to the hills and plains, trying to take gold from humans or dwarves. A few had even tried to strike down the elves, but between the excellent elven archers, and the fact that most elves in this region are more inclined towards living wild and free, rather than rich and decadently, they wound up getting very little for their trouble, besides arrow wounds. <nl> But she'd been listening from a distance to some of those bothersome lesser races that sometimes come around to try and drive some of the other young dragons away, or perhaps kill them. She had mostly listened because their troubadour sang very beautifully, and to know if they were hunting her. But when they spoke to one another, they spoke of something called a ''quest''. A form of task, given to you at something called an ''Adventurers' Guild''. And if you completed this task, you were given gold. <nl> Gold, which is what all dragons desire. For a number of reasons. Mostly for purposes of social hierarchy. A dragon with more gold is respected, while one with little gold is considered a nuisance, and is usually expected to obey richer dragons, or face social exclusion. And since these mortals get paid in gold for doing tasks, she reasoned that she too could get paid for doing these quests. Certainly sounded easier than trying to dig up the burial mounds of dead kings, or stealing it from mortals. <nl> It was early morning when she landed in front of the building, which had a sign outside of it proclaiming it to be the local offices of the Guild of Heroes, Adventurers, and Associated Trades. She had flown above the town for a couple of days before she'd gone down there, having observed how these quests worked. Outside of the guild building, there was a large place for posting various tasks. Some adventurers, usually in groups of four or five, took a piece of paper from the board, and then walked inside the building. So she did essentially the same. She landed in front of the board, and picked one that sounded feasible. Capture or kill the centaur highwayman Artonak. She wasn't too big, so she could still fit through the main door of the building. The people on the other side were dumbstruck by her sudden appearance. <nl> She looked around, ''*I want to do this quest thing. Bring in a bandit? Yes. I get paid in gold?*'' A gnome, who had fallen on his back when she'd walked in got up and looked at her incredulously. ''*But you're a dragon?*'' She nodded. ''*Yes. You pay in gold for centaur highwayman?*'' She handed the gnome the piece of paper detailing the quest. The gnome then turned to his the other people and started a conversation with them, speaking hurriedly. Her common wasn't good enough to follow the conversation that the gnome had with the other people in there. But when she coughed, they all turned back to her with obvious terror. <nl> ''*Uh. Yes. We'll pay for Artonak in gold. The bastard has been hitting merchants and travellers for months. Supposedly his lair is somewhere in the hills outside of town*'' Happy to have been proven correct, she was about to back out of the building before the gnome spoke up hurriedly again. ''*Uh, you just have to register as an adventurer first.*'' She thought it over, and nodded. She didn't exactly understand the language enough, but the staff at the building managed to make her understand that she needed to tell them who she was, and write down her name on a piece of very small paper, otherwise she would not get the gold. She signed as Teristrolkanovy de Wrelros'Dai, which was only the first part of her name. She might not entirely understand what they talking about, but she recognised a contract when she saw one, and no dragon ever reveals their full name. <nl> After that, she bolted, and flew away, following the highway out of town. And from above, it was a lot easier to spot where the centaur was setting up a trap for a stagecoach. As he kicked down a partially felled tree in front of the horses, and jumped out with crossbows in his hands, she swept down and grasped him in her claws. The shocked centaur dropped his crossbows, and the sheer shock of her sudden swooping attack, allowed her to completely disarm him, using a tactic her parents had taught her when dealing with armoured knights on armoured horses. <nl> When she landed again, the centaur was completely stripped naked, and also in deep shock. She'd landed in front of the guildhouse, where a number of armoured adventurers, and the staff from inside of the building were standing, and talking in very heated tones. Those were silenced when she landed, and placed the centaur in front of the gnome that had talked to her earlier. ''*Please give money.*'' The adventurers had all drawn forth a truly astonishing amount of rare and unusual weaponry when she landed. But the staff explained that since she'd brought in her first quest target, she was technically an adventurer. And since she'd brought in an outlaw, she wasn't an enemy. <nl> The adventurers all sheathed their weapons, and the gnome fetched her prize. 200 gold pieces. Which was a lot more gold pieces than she'd thought, as she was still very new to the business. She placed the gold in the crudely crafted bag she carried on her back, which contained the only things she'd owned before getting kicked out of her parents' cave. Which consisted of a large and worn velvet blanket, a breastplate with a mirror enchantment on it, allowing her to look at herself in it, woolly earmuffs made from woolly mammoth, and a toy rabbit. <nl> She had many questions about more quests, and eventually, the guild staff had to bring in a translator, as her questions got more complicated, and so did the answers. They explained to her how adventurers travelled between towns, doing quests, helping people, and how it was important that she circled around in the region. Which they had added because if they didn't she'd probably stop anything bigger than goblins on her own, leaving most of that town's resident adventurers out of a job. <nl>'She had many questions about more quests, and eventually, the guild staff had to bring in a translator, as her questions got more complicated, and so did the answers.

Happy with having earned the first part of her hoard, she flew on to the next town, where the locals were equally confused and worried about a young dragon swooping in and accepting quests. They were quite happy when she managed to track down a band of slavers, kill them, and bring back the people they'd taken in raids. <nl> That town too sent her on, and like a knight errant, she travelled from town to town, earning a lot of gold, till her backpack was swollen. She was worried about suddenly having to leave her gold behind, but having learned more about the common speech, she enquired with the guild, and discovered a new concept, new to dragons at least. Banks. Put your hoard inside of a vault, lock the door, and it'd be safe. So she happily deposited her hoard, especially after they explained how compound interest worked. <eos>
