<sos> So, you finally decided to stop being a sad sack of crap and become a REAL Man(tm)? <nl> Since you're smart enough to read, probably, you're maybe smart enough to not screw this up. Using the REAL Man(tm) method, you'll find the perfect fuckbunny in a week, or you're destined to be alone forever. Either way, no skin off my ass. <nl> Step 1. R. Relate. Tell her everything you know about whatever she's doing. Using Excel? List off all the commands you know. Making you a soft serve cone? Tell her all about Glucose and Lactose and their relationship. <nl> Women love it when a REAL Man can make it so they don't have to use their tiny brains, because YOU think for them. <nl> Step 2. E. Emote. When she tells you that she has a boyfriend, start crying. When she tells you all about her funny grandpa's walking farts, laugh. <nl> Women are simple, and they are easily tricked into liking men by you pretending you give a hoot about their shoes or whatever it is girls talk about. <nl>E. Entice. Buy her flowers, pay for her dinner, and show her that you can be a real gentleman. Also, don't forget to mention that you love her even though you just met her yesterday.<nl><nl> Step 3. A. Assassinate. They have a husband? Kill him to keep him out of the way. Her dad says you're not good enough for his princess? Take him out. <nl> You need to let nothing stand between you and your girl, not even laws or morals. <nl> Finally, if your dumb ass has made it this far, we're on the final step. Get out your fingers, I know you need to count. <nl> Good job, we're on Step 4. <nl> Step 4. L. Loiter. Hang around her, forcing her to see you as much as possible. Sit on the hood of her car when you know she's working. Go to the restaurant and order a refill of coffee every 15 minutes so she has to interact with you. <nl> They say distance makes the heart grow stronger, but who ever "they" are, is full of shit. <nl> If you followed these steps properly, you're either in bed with the girl of your dreams, or you're in prison. Stay tuned for our next REAL guide, How REAL Men(tm) Survive Prison! <eos>
