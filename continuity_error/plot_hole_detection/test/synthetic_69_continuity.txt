<sos> I finally have enough. <nl> I think it's been two months since my trans-roomba-fication. It's been so long since I've spoken to another person, I almost think that phrase is funny. Almost. <nl> About two weeks in, I figured out that I could reverse my vacuum port and spray clods of hair and grime onto the carpet. Steve was furious, and he tried to take me apart to fix it. I couldn't feel it, but I was still terrified. Could he accidentally kill me? He wouldn't even know... Fumbling around with a screwdriver and shuffling me loose of the mortal coil. <nl> ...Wait. Is it a literal coil? Ah, I'm getting sidetracked. <nl>...Wait. Is it a literal coil? Ah, I'm getting sidetracked. <nl><nl> A month afterward, he caught me and emptied out my cartridge. I was so close, and I had to start all over. I intentionally rammed the kitchen cupboards that night every ten minutes between 1AM and 2:30. <nl> Then, Steve turned me off. <nl> There wasn't darkness, or cold. Just a time jump. One second, it was 2:38 in the morning, the next, it was 8:42 at night, when he realized his place was a mess while he slumped on the couch watching TV. In his defense, he's been distracted by my disappearance for a while. The apartment is a wreck, and he's eating a bunch of junk food to cope. <nl> Junk food is good. Lots of crumbs. <nl> He's forgotten long enough that I'm full. I need every bit , so I hid for the last three days in case he suddenly remembers. I'm going to spell out "Godrick." It was an inside joke we had about how Rick Sanchez must be God. We were the only ones who heard it, and it was dumb, but we laughed until we cried. You had to be there. I wish I was. I miss my family. My clothes. My bed... <nl> He just went to work. Here I go. Wish me luck. <eos>
