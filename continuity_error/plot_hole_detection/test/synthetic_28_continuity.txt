continuity 24
<sos> I was pretty deep in denial to see my most beloved 16-year-old at my door. *Riordan, what the frick.* I was pretty confused and sure that somehow somebody had the mad idea to lace those brownies at the cafe with LSD and feed it to a 14-year-old . "Magnus, what in the Hellheim," I stated, not missing my chance to drop a reference. "Look, I know this is a lot for you to take in right now, but you gotta listen carefully. You're my favorite book character, I know how your story ends, and I need to change it. Fast." <nl> "Wait-what. Lemme pull a UNO reverse card straight here, you're *my* favorite character!" I stated, pointing an accusing finger at him. "What?" he said in disbelief, and in those seconds I had never felt more meme-like. "There's no time for this!" He pushed past me, looking at the clock. 4:45. "Oh, no no no. We have to get ready *fast.*" He whipped his head towards me, taking my arm. "Get everything you can carry in a small backpack," he ordered walking me quickly towards my room. I obeyed, taking a backpack and shoving in clothes, my phone, a laptop and other precious sundry. Even a deck of UNO was shoved in. "Do you have a rock?" he asked quickly. "No, why?" <nl> "We need to get a rock!" he said loudly, tromping through my house. He tried the back door to the yard, pulling on it in frustration. I nudged him aside, taking a key out from the shelf. "Hurry, hurry!" he said, sounding stressed and desperate. I shoved the key in, turned, and went out into the yard. He went around, looking through the dirt and plants for one. "Got it!" a rock was raised into the air in a triumphant fist. "Call your friends, we need them here earlier," he said, calmer now. I took out my phone and messaged the group chat with "get over here i found magnus chase". Some contemplation followed, then a "seriously gt over". I heard a whooshing noise, like lots of tiny marbles across hardwood. "It's time," Magnus said, looking up. "The Sand's here." <eos>
