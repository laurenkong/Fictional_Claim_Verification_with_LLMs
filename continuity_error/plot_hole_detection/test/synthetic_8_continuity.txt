continuity 4
<sos> A man awakens in a room. <nl> There isn't anything else in the room worth describing.  A table, to be sure, but stainless steel and sterile.  Well, the man's in a chair, too, but that should go without saying. <nl>Certainly, but please do remember that we have no responsibility for any damages to your own person," the abductor replies, with a sly grin. <nl> 14<nl><nl> The man is confused, as most men are.  He's got a bit of a jowl situation going on, and if you look at him from this light, which is pointed directly into his face, he looks remarkably like a beige frog. <nl> Still air, recycled air, dry air, causes the man to cough.  Moving his neck side to side, he tries to remove some of the strain, but his eyelids seem to be weighted, and he struggles to stay awake. <nl> As if on cue, which it is, a door whooshes open behind him, the fancy kind that reads your biological makeup and decides it's very important for you to enter this room, right here, right now.  Very expensive.  Very flashy.  Good for impressing any potential clients. <nl> Anyway, the intruder makes his way into the room, and pulls a chair up in front of the other.  The frog-looking man blinks in confusion, the drugs still working their way out of his system. <nl> "Where am I?"  he asks. <nl> Sensible question. <nl> "You've been abducted," his abductor says, quite cheerfully. <nl> Sensible answer. <nl> The abducted man tries to stand, but realizes he's being restrained in this chair.  Arms, legs, torso, even his feet stick to the floor as if powerful magnets have been inserted into the soles of his shoes. <nl> Which they have been. <nl> "What am I doing here?" <nl> Another sensible question.  No time to spend debating as to why this man's been abducted, which most people tend to do. <nl> "To be frank, Mr. Salvador, you're up here for legal reasons." <nl> The restrained man eyes his captor.  An extraordinarily handsome gentlemen.  Two arms.  Two legs.  Two eyes.  Nothing particularly out of the ordinary. <nl> He presses a button beneath the table, and the wall behind him transforms into a window. <nl> Mr. Salvador finds himself quite distressed.  Not only has he been abducted, but he's trapped somewhere in space, orbiting over Earth. <nl> "Am I in some kind of space station?" <nl> "A space ship, if you're looking for easy classification.  We just need you to sign here, Mr. Salvador." <nl> A piece of paper materializes on the table, and to Mr. Salvador's surprise, a long contract headlined by the Disney corporation logo appears at the top. <nl> "Your planet runs our third most popular Milky Way reality show, Mr. Salvador, but frankly, our ratings have been tanking.  Not only that, but you're expensive to maintain.  The galactic blackout around your planet to prevent any kind of external contact isn't cheap." <nl> The man in the suit watches Mr. Salvador, his voice pumped full of the kind of cheery optimism to chirp up anyone on a cloudy day. <nl> "But we'd planned on cancelling about seven years ago, but frankly the whole 'continental shift' that was supposed to wipe out all human life didn't particularly go as planned.   So we're here for plan B." <nl> Mr. Salvador's mouth opens slightly, perfecting the imitation of a frog. <nl> "But you're a human?" he asks. <nl> He'd always imagined aliens would be of the tentacled or insect variety, but this was a man.  Indistinguishable.  Not even those forehead ridges you'll see on campy sci-fi shows from the seventies and eighties.  Not something identical. <nl> "Most people are," his captor responds. <nl> "So you're an alien?" <nl> "Alien's a relative term, Mr. Salvador.  I'm here so you understand your part here, and we just need you to sign." <nl> Mr. Salvador blinks once.  Twice.  Thrice. <nl> "Are there people out there?  Are we alone in the universe?" <nl> The questions came unbidden, and seemed standard to the situation.  Neither the abductor nor the abuctee really cared too much about the answers, but this was the time and place to get them out of the way. <nl> "Yes to both, but your planet in particular isn't anything special.  A grafted world to mimic our own, but when it comes down to it, we're here for entertainment." <nl> He taps the paper. <nl> "Sign." <nl> "What if I don't?  You haven't told me why I'm here." <nl> The man in the suit gives a disapproving tut, and gestures out the window. <nl> "While we'd never force anyone, it'd be quite the shame if you were to be accidentally ejected from an airlock.People are cheap, Mr. Salvador, and we're only here to provide you an exciting business opportunity.  A way to be a pioneer for life on Earth.  The reason's as good as any other." <nl> Mr. Salvador wants to believe what the suit is telling him, as most people do, when they're restrained to chairs and fairly aware of the imminent threat of violence.  Still, he hesitates. <nl> "Is there something you're not telling me?  Why do you need me to sign it anyway?  You already brought me onto the ship." <nl> The question feels ridiculous, but he can barely think straight.  Something out a bizarre fevered dream. <nl> "Plenty," the abductor says.  "But we respect the autonomy and value of human life, and would like to get your approval before we move forward with this project.  Call it moral and bureaucratic approval." <nl> The man in the chair nods in a kind of detached agreement, and his chins give a slight shake.  There's nothing particularly impressive about him, traveling around and making sure paper work is correct wherever he goes. <nl> Mr. Salvador can lift his arm, and proceeds to sign.  He doesn't really see much reason not to, and he doesn't think he'd get a lawyer if he asked. <nl> "Why the Disney logo?" he asks. <nl> "Well, Disney is everywhere.  They pop up on every human world in one form or another.  Different names, different logos.  Usually." <nl> He rolls up the sheet, and stands, tucking it into an immaculate suit. <nl> A smile.  Wide and predatory. <nl> A needle pops out from the ceiling, injecting Mr. Salvador with - something. <nl> "From now on, you'll be known as patient zero, Mr. Salvador, and released back into captivity after a memory wipe." <nl> Mr. Salvador begins to sweat. <nl> "What did you inject me with?" <nl> The man in the suit shrugs. <nl> "Hopefully something of the entertaining sort.  Like if ebola and smallpox had a baby, and that baby decided to have an exceptionally infectious disease." <nl> Before Mr. Salvador can raise a protest, another needle pricks him with something else, the kind of thick viscous liquid that pumps through your veins and sends you off to dreamland. <nl> The next solar cycle, on the third rock from the sun, in a particular solar system populated mostly by naked apes, a man gets into his car before going on a business trip. <nl> He looks at himself in the mirror.  Quite like a frog. <nl> One cough.  Two. <nl> He puts a tissue to his lips, but balls it up, tossing it to the passenger seat. <nl> If he'd looked closely, he'd see it speckled with blood. <nl> Carrying a pathogen. <nl> He arrives at the airport, infecting nearly three dozen people at the TSA.  On the plane, he can't seem to stop sneezing, gets up, goes into the lavatory, and hocks an exceptionally large and ominously colored glob of snot.  Two days later, he lays on a hotel bed, sweat soaking into the sheets and nearly delirious from fever. <nl> In his confusion, he thinks he remembers a room and a man, somewhere far above the sky, whirling through the dark with more stars than he'd ever known. <nl> He dies alone.  As most people do. <nl> The man in the ship watches with analytical interest, completely detached as to the reality of the situation below, and begins to plot out how the pathogen will spread. <nl> Cameras everywhere in the atmosphere, satellites linked to a comprehensive network, capable of portraying almost every human's struggle to an audience in the trillions. <nl> *This'll be good,* he thinks.  *Violent.  Savage.  Give it a few weeks, and their meticulously built global structures should fall.  Mass chaos, mass looting, hopefully a few conventional wars.  Something to really shake up the status quo, get some quality plot twists going on their whole direction as a species.* <nl> Few things can really shake up a world order like a seemingly unstoppable disease, mutated out several meticulously selected strains, brought and tested by bio-engineers.  Last time they'd gotten a significant boost by starting a pair of world wars, but these days things were too interconnected.  A disease would turn that right on its head, use it against them. <nl> He hopes it'll raise the ratings, but if nothing else, they'll just launch the rock into the sun if the thing turns into a bust and collect the insurance money. <nl> As long as they remain in the black, it doesn't matter how the money is made.  Hell, a staged 'Alien Invasion' may work if the population recovers fast enough.  That'd be some quality drama. <nl> In his office, the man in the suit, who is still a man but not from Earth, watches the blue ball with disinterest. <nl> So it goes. <nl> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <nl> r/storiesfromapotato - for stuff from me <nl> r/redditserials - for longer stuff from me and others <eos>
