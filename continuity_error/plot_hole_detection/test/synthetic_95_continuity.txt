continuity 89
<sos> If Bob had been a first-year sorcerer, wet behind the ears, still brimming with enthusiasm with every successful spell cast without a master's supervision, he would likely have made a mistake. Perhaps he would have been tempted to let the golden retriever out from the summoning circle, certain he had made a mistake. Or he may have chalked up what he had heard as mere tricks of the mind, exhausted as he was from casting the forbidden 8th-level spell. He may even have tried the spell again, which most certainly would have killed him. <nl> But Bob was a seasoned sorcerer, one of the most promising names in decades. And so he made his assessments, just as he had been taught. <nl> "My spell worked, I am sure of it," he said, glancing down at his palms. Blue smoke still rose in curly tendrils, proof that he had spellwoven correctly. <nl> "Er, yes, the spell was performed quite impressively," said Winston, whose vocabulary was very notable given that he had only been given to variations of "woof", "bark", "whine" and "growl" before today. <nl> "So it's not the spell, and it's not the circle," said Bob, as he got on his knees to inspect his preparations again. "And I'm not mad, though of course if I really was I wouldn't know it. But let's assume my mind is still my own. That leaves only a number of possibilities." <nl> Winston sat on his rump, then started scratching at his ears with his hind paws. He waited patiently, though truth be told, it was not like he had anywhere to go, not until Bob released him. <nl> Bob snapped his fingers, and fine filaments of power flowed into the circle, throwing up a cascade of sparks. "As long as the circle holds, I can compel you to speak the truth," said Bob. "So answer me this - are you the very same pet that has been by my side for the last 3 years?" <nl> "You don't need to compel me," said Winston. "I'm just happy to finally be able to speak. You have no idea how difficult it was to communicate without words." <nl> "Well, are you?" pressed Bob. "Are you the same dog?" <nl> "Yes, I am." <nl> "Second question then" said Bob. "Are you also really the most powerful demon there is in the underworld?" <nl> Though he tried to keep his expression neutral, Winston's energetic tail wagging gave away the fact that he was positively brimming with pride. "Well, that's not what I would say of myself," said Winston, "but I know that there are many humans who call me that, you know? The other demons will never admit it, but it's been some time since any of them have challenged my turf." <nl> "Really?" asked Winston. "You're Nazcara, also known as the Quencher of Flames, the Worldender, the Final Horseman? The demon which single-handedly stopped the High Priest Malison from conquering the entire world in the 12th century? The immortal foe which the greatest bloodknight in human history, St Lueda, couldn't quell in the 17th century? The cursed beast which halted the campaign of Emperor Xu Lei in the 19th century?" <nl> "That's me," said Winston. <nl> "A golden retriever did all that?" asked Bob, throwing up his hands in the air. <nl> Winston shrugged, or at least gave the best impression of one which a dog could muster. His tail started wagging again. "This form suits me well," he said. "Some of the other demons prefer other sorts of eldritch horrors, but this... this works just fine." <nl> "How much power do you actually have?" asked Bob. "Because I'm sensing a whole lot of nothing coming from that circle. I'm not sure you have more than two fireballs in you, even. Is there more? Are there hidden reserves of magic in you, ready to be unleashed?" <nl> Winston's tail flagged for a moment. "No, not really," he said. "What you see is what you get. Hey, as I said, I never claimed to be the strongest or anything. It was your spell that had its own interpretation of what the most dangerous demon would be." <nl> Bob held on to the tether connecting him to the portal, then he stumbled back, and plopped himself onto the nearby chair. "But... this is all wrong," he said, more for his own sake than for Winston's. "I put the last of what I had into that spell. The last of my fortunes, my bloodsacrifices... that spell was all I had left. And I find that it's you? Why were you already with me all along? It doesn't make sense..." <nl> Out of habit, Winston moved to comfort his master, but his snout bounced off the edge of his prison. "What were you looking for when you summoned me?" he asked. <nl> Bob thought for a while, then said, "Power, of course. Power." <nl> "Don't you already have that?" <nl> "I do," said Bob. "But something's... gone awry. I'm still strong, stronger than most of my peers. But I've hit a wall, hit the limits of what I can do. Every time I take another step forwards, I find myself merely... content to be where I am. I wanted to harness your powers, reignite the hunger within, claim what is rightfully mine." <nl> "But why do you want to do that?" asked Winston. <nl> Bob laughed, then suddenly hit the tabletop with such force that the half-consumed candles on the stand fell off. "I'm asking the questions here! Who sent you! How did you find me! What have you been doing by my side these 3 years?" <nl> Winston cocked his head to the side as he tried to recall the information he needed. "A coalition summoned me," he answered. "A group which formed against you, comprised of your enemies. They pulled me out from the underworld 3 years ago, then deposited me at your doorstep, giving me little time to finalize my form." <nl> "Why, why would they do that?" asked Bob. <nl> "Why, to stop you, of course," said Winston. "To ensure you never fulfilled your destiny of taking over the world." <nl> The answer had barely left Winston's snout when the realization hit Bob like a gale-force tornado. The moment of clarity was so strong, so thoroughly cleansing that the breath was stolen from Bob, such that he had to gasp in reply. <nl>The chalice shattered into a thousand pieces, the ruby shards scattering everywhere. But as Bob watched in horror, the chalice slowly reformed itself, the scarlet gem floating back into place.<nl><nl> "You, it was you..." Bob said. "You were the one who took it away. You were the one who robbed me of my hunger to sunder the world. All those times that you demanded my attention, that you distracted me from my research, it was you who led me astray..." <nl> Winston frowned, and he had to stop himself from growling. "I wouldn't put it that way," he said. "I brought to you many things which you never had before in your life. Company, solace, friendship, all those things denied to you because of your lineage. I made you care for something other than just yourself, and in the process you learned more about life, and why it is worth preserving, did you not?" <nl> Bob leapt to his feet, then swept the scrolls and books off the table in a rage. "I asked for none of that! I only decided to let you live because you looked as pitiful as I was, all those years ago when I was abandoned at the Academy! I thought it would be just the two of us, in our quest to rule the world! How was I to know that you were a festering demon, sapping my ambition, my desire, from the shadows!" <nl> Bob grabbed a rubied chalice, flung it at Winston. The ornament bounced off the edges of the circle, sizzling sparks at the point of contact. <nl> "How was I to know that you were a foul Demon of Contentment!" yelled Bob. <nl> Winston waited as his master sobbed. Minutes passed, and if he were a first-year demon, wet behind the ears, still brimming with enthusiasm with every human he corrupted, he would likely have wrongly believed he would be banished. <nl> But Winston was a seasoned demon, one of the most dangerous ones to lurk the underworld. And so he made his move, just as he had practiced over the countless millennia. <nl> "Master," he said, when he judged the time was right. "As long as I am with you, I doubt that you'll ever push yourself the way you did back at the Academy. I also doubt you'll attain your dream of ruling the world before 40, as you swore you would. But I assure you, the days will be fruitful, the nights will bring peace, and you will never want for anything you cannot easily achieve. Happiness, master, is only a few steps away. Come, the circle needs smudging." <nl> Bob eventually moved from his seat, and with the edge of his shoe, scrubbed away the edges of the circle, breaking the containment spell. <nl> Winston leapt into his master's arms, licking Bob's face over and over again. <nl> He hadn't liked it when men had first called him a demon, much less so when any of his masters ever blamed him for things he didn't feel he deserved. But if it meant that he could spend more time with some of these humans, who clearly lacked for the things which he could give, then he supposed it was worth it. <nl> --- <nl> /r/rarelyfunny <eos>
