continuity 14
<sos> Klaus was getting irritated. Every decade or so, another snot-nosed brat would hammer at the gates, yammering something about destiny and how they had to right the ancient wrong or something like that. They generally were easy to kill, but this last one had blinded his favorite dragonling. Kiara was only 20 years old and not even able to breathe fire yet, and that lumbering oaf had blinded her! Enough was enough. <nl> Klaus gathered several of his dragonriders, and they flew towards the peak of Mount Vernon. As they neared the peak, strong winds began to pick up, trying to blow them off course. They landed and the dragons made their way up the mountain on foot, Klaus and his retinue huddled down in their saddles. <nl> A sphinx rose up in front of them. "Only the pure of heart may approach-" The rest of the sentence was lost as Klaus's mount, Kiara's mother, flamed it. They walked around the merrily burning pile of feathers and bone. <nl> They made it to the cave at the peak. "Dinar, you come out here right this instant!" Klaus roared. <nl>The dragons flew back to their lair, Kiara's siblings rejoicing at their successful mission. As they celebrated, Klaus couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. <nl><nl> The silence lasted for a few minutes. Finally, from deep inside the cave, a muffled voice replied, "No." <nl> Klaus glowered at the cave. "I'm sick of you sending those naive idiots to bother me. Your sacrifice of these poor young fools must stop." <nl> The voice replied, "It's not my fault they're not strong enough to stop you." <nl> Klaus drew his sword. "Stop sending those children to do the dirty work for you. Come out and face me, man to man." When no one appeared at the entrance, Klaus shrugged. "Have it your way." He directed his men to tear down the cave entrance. As the stones collapsed, he called out, "No other mothers will lose their sons to your insanity. Stop bothering my people with your delusions. Father chose me to rule, and that's that." As they flew away, Klaus shook his head. Hopefully this would stop Dinar's ambitions for a short time. <eos>
