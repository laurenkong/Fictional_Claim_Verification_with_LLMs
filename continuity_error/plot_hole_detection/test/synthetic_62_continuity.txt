<sos> As Tutrig awoke, <nl> He first thought it a joke, <nl> That the night before was so clear. <nl> But with a cold creeping sweat, <nl> He did recollect, <nl> How the Dwarves had rung in New Year. <nl> Satmoc Minebane, <nl>First she did trim, <nl>But her hair was still grim, <nl>So for the first time, a dwarf did shave.<nl><nl> Had drunk all the champagne, <nl> And went streaking down through the hall. <nl> Yolack thought it a lass, <nl> Complimented that ass, <nl> But got more than he bargained for. <nl> As for Sanmolda, <nl> She lowered her shoulders, <nl> As she watched her husband be kissed. <nl> Although a mistake, <nl> His trousers did quake, <nl> Satmoc had stolen her bliss. <nl> With swift resolution, <nl> She found a solution, <nl> As she sharpened the blade of her axe. <nl> First she did trim, <nl> But her hair was still grim, <nl> So for the first time, a dwarf did wax. <nl> When Yolack saw her, <nl> He said 'wife I adore ya, <nl> I forgot 'bout the goods under there.' <nl> But Sanmolda did scolder, <nl> Shoved him up by a boulder, <nl> Said 'I'm more than what's under my hair!' <nl> 'Lover forgive me, <nl> I know I'm no Gimli, <nl> I'm begging you please take me back.' <nl> 'Only if you do the same... <nl> If you can handle the pain, <nl> Of waxing each crevis and crack.' <nl> Tutrig remembered, <nl> The tears that descended, <nl> The face of a man full of fear. <nl> He reached for a bottle, <nl> His memory he'd throttle, <nl> Of another damned Dwarven New Year. <eos>
