continuity 16
<sos> Some people chase after money. Others chase after love. Still others chase after books, movies, hell, even writing. I couldn't even imagine: just sitting in front of your computer coming up with stories. Why do that when you could go out and make your own? <nl> But all of them, yes even the writers, are looking for one thing: that elusive Rush. The feeling you get once a blue moon that makes you think, "yeah, this is what I live for." The pounding heart, the excitement, the adrenaline, the *life.* Some people get it when getting that paycheck others get it by driving at 300 miles per hour or jumping off a plane. <nl> I got the Rush by watching the light fade out of someone's eyes. <nl> I looked in the mirror again. Red lipstick but not too red. I was playing Mary Sue - inexperienced, but eager. I wore a dark blue dress that fell down to my ankles with but an open back. Little eyeliner to accent my eyes, and my dark hair was pulled into a simple ponytail. The perfect Mary Sue. <nl>After taking another swig of the poisoned beer, I discreetly slipped the antidote into my own drink when he wasn't looking.<nl><nl> I blew a kiss to the mirror and went to see my date. <nl> *** <nl> He was ten minutes late. <nl> He looked like his profile picture at least. Tall, he was around my height, tan skin and curly blond hair. He wore a button down shirt with rolled up sleeves and black pants. Time to play my part. <nl> Though I wanted to throttle him for being late I got up in a calculated movement, expertly knocking my chair back, like I was some flustered idiot, and stumbled. <nl> He was at my side immediately, helping me regain my balance. I fluttered my eyes at him. "Oh, I-I'm sorry, I'm always just so clumsy." I used an old theater trick to make the blood rush to my cheeks, making him think I was blushing. <nl> "Oh, um, it's fine. In fact, I should be the one apologizing for being late," he said, looking like a kid who'd gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar. <nl> I laughed at the expression. Wow, that was actually kind of cute. <nl> "So, um, should we sit?" <nl> *** <nl> He told me jokes and stories. I just blushed at first, giving him slight smiles, but then as I sipped at the wine, I let myself open up, laugh a little more, casually brush my fingers against his. This one was devious. I could see the glint in his eyes now that wasn't there when he'd help me from my stumble. The innocent face was a disguise. A damn good one at that, if it had fooled me, though only for a few minutes. <nl> But I wasn't me, I was Mary Sue. So, I drank more wine and laughed harder at his jokes. I guess I'd take him back to my kill house - his type would say yes, I was sure. <nl> I could probably overpower him, but he was well built and must have at least 50 pounds on me, Didn't hurt to be sure though I supposed. So when the food arrived, I made a show of digging in my purse for my phone. I opened a case inside my purse and carefully picked up a single grain of the poison and crushed it between two of my fingers. <nl> I flashed him an embarrassed smile and squeezed his fingers - getting the colorless poison on them. We were having wings, so no silverware involved - he'd ingest the poison. It wouldn't kill him immediately, but it would begin working through his system, making him weak, easier to overpower. <nl> Another job well done. He opened both of our bottles of beer with his key chain bottle opener and we clinked our glasses. I took a swig of the drink. He put his drink down and bit into one of his wings. <nl> Both of us froze. <nl> That *bastard.* It was subtle, but it was there. Gloriella. It didn't really have a taste, but I could feel the powder warm on my tongue as I drank the beer. He was here to kill *me.* It wouldn't kill me immediately, I had a couple of hours to safely to take the antidote. He had frozen too, a bit comically, with his teeth half biting into the wing. He recognized the poison. <nl> I began to laugh. <nl> He shook his head and showed me his teeth; a predator's smile. I matched his with one of my own and undid my hair, letting it fan across my back while he unbuttoned the top button of his shirt. Seemingly small gestures to any onlooker, but to professional killers it was like taking off a costume. Mary Sue was gone with her silly laughing and perpetual blush. <nl> He had changed too. Gone was the good boy look, and the more sinister side I'd seen a shadow of dominated him now. He leaned back in his chair, wearing an expression of supreme confidence. <nl> "Poison on the fingers eh?" he said with a sardonic smile, not even bothering to keep his voice low. No one would hear us over the din of conversations all around us. <nl> I shrugged one shoulder in a casual gesture. "Less cliche than poisoning a girl's drink at least." <nl> He rolled his eyes. "Oh please, the classics are classics for a reason. If it works, it works." <nl> "Well," I said after taking another swig of the *poisoned* beer. "It didn't." <nl> He blinked a few times at me drinking again, then a slow smile spread across his lips. A game. He dropped the wing entirely and very purposefully sucked the tips of his fingers clean, making sure to get all the poison I'd gotten on them. <nl> "You missed a spot," I said, and offered him my hand. <nl> "My, my, aren't we forward," he said, putting his hand on his chest in mock shock. But he then took my hand is other one and kissed my fingers. <nl> I raised my own beer in salute and drank the rest of it in one gulp. <nl> *** <nl> We were outside now, and he walked me to my car like a real gentleman. I had no idea where this was going really, but I was ready. I had a knife strapped to my thigh and a gun in my purse. I wasn't an idiot but...I wanted to see where this was going. <nl> We got to my car and I turned to him. Only part of his face was illuminated by the neon lights of the restaurant sign, but I could see one half of his lips curve up in that trademark smile of his. <nl> He leaned forward and, after a moment, so did I. <nl> Our lips touched. <nl> We stood there, not kissing, but touching lips, exchanging the poison residue both of us had on our lips. It was stupid, borderline suicidal, but hell if it wasn't fun. He pulled back a shade before I did. <nl> My heart was beating wildly, threatening to jump out of my chest, and my cheeks were actually flushed. This was it, the Rush. And no one had died, or at least, not yet. <nl> "So...will I see you again?" he asked. <nl> I grinned. <nl> *** <nl> (minor edits) <nl> If you enjoyed this, you'll like a story I wrote for literally this exact prompt like half a year ago. Though I warn you it goes a little bit....differently.
