continuity 13
<sos> I turned the T.V. off and listened to the soft blowing wind from the cracked window next to me. I slid it closed as the words rolled over me, their meaning slowly taking hold. <nl> "Military aid is unavailable," the grim-faced man said before wishing everyone that could hear his voice good luck as the station went back to the crawling white letters over the black screen. Normally the screen would have an accompanied several loud screeches that made my ears want to bleed, but not tonight. <nl> For a few moments I stared at the blank screen, mouth slightly agape, my eyebrows coming together. The broadcast felt like a joke, some elaborate prank on the city. Something to be ignored, laughed at for a passing moment before you got back to your life. As the words settled in me something else bloomed; fear. Anxiety. Tension that busied my hands with the hem of my shirt as the sounds from across the street at the Stevenson house flowed into my ears. <nl> I could see the party starting up, hear the laughing and the overly loud talking. Behind the two-story house I could see the sun kissing the horizon, staining the sky in pinks and oranges that seeped lower and grew darker with each passing second. I watched a car pull up to the already cluttered curb and park, a pair of nicely dressed women stumbling out with drunken giggles. I watched them trek through the freshly mowed lawn and knock on the front door, a crisp red. I watched until the light that spilled out through the doorway was cut off and turned back to my empty house. <nl> Barricading the doors was easy enough and for once I was thankful for all the extra supplies from the do-it-yourself kitchen renovation my one time brother-in-law has insisted upon. I had just enough wood for the doors and most of the windows. By the time I hammered in that last nail, securing the piece of pale wood in place, the sun was gone and the sky was dark. The realization hit me harder than words can describe. <nl> The words of that anchor came to mind. "Do not make any light or noise between 6 P.M. and 8 A.M.," and a new kind of fear sent my heart thrashing behind the cage of bone. I could taste each quick beat; salty pennies with the burn of bile from my churning stomach. <nl> The clock on the stove, those bright red numbers, read 7:42 P.M. My mouth dried out with a breath. How had the time gone so quickly? I hurried over the tiled floor and covered the numbers with a hand towel, taping it in place with a strip of duct tape. No light. <nl> Each light on the bottom floor clicked off with a soft sound that I felt the entire world could hear. With the last little sound I stood in the dark  living room and waited. For what? Death? My mind showed me monsters, creatures from worlds I'll never know. Horrible beasts with sharp teeth and strong jaws. Things with knives for fingers that long to bathe in my blood. I stood there conjuring up every kind of terrible sight and could still hear the party across the street. <nl> It sounded like things were kicking into high gear. Music throbbed, vibrating the world around it the home. The voices from the yard, both back and front, seeped through my walls hitting my ears muffled and slurred. A delighted scream sent me stomping up the stairs and to my bedroom and to the window pointing out to the neighborhood below. <nl> An impossibly tall and thin figure wrenched a wriggling woman towards the sidewalk. She screamed and giggled and seemed to lightly hit at the figure that kept pulling her along like she weighed less than a feather. No one at the party seemed to mind, or seemed to take much notice at all. The figure took the hits and kept walking, and walking, until they were past the boundaries of my picture window. The next scream I heard wasn't playful, or fun. It was loud, shrill, and filled with pain. <nl> It sent a spurt of adrenaline through my legs that twitched my calves, made me want to move, to help, to do anything but sit and watch those shadow covered bodies like they were some kind of T.V. show. But I didn't. I didn't help and I didn't move. Not when the screams suddenly cut off mid-sound, and not when that figure strolled back to the party, moving among the bodies like water between rocks. <nl> When the second figure moved into the crowd, ducking through the open front door to get inside, I backed away from the window. I backed up until my legs hit the edge of my bed, I moved around it until my fingertips brushed over her bedside table. I guess it was my bedside table, now. They both were. I couldn't stop the thoughts from flooding my mind, the questions. Was she safe? Were both of them? Did they catch the warning or were they doing something else at the time or were they too busy unpacking in their new home? <nl>I watched a car pull up to the already cluttered curb and park, a pair of nicely dressed women stumbling out with drunken giggles. I watched them trek through the freshly mowed lawn and knock on the front door, a crisp red."<nl><nl> That question pushed me down the stairs as quick and as silent as I can manage on wood steps, and to the front door. Through the cracks I could hear more blood-chilling screams that raised every little hair on my body. They were close. So close. Just beyond the thick wood, calling me forth. Calling me for help. <nl> I'm not a brave person, and I've never claimed to be such, but walking away from those screams, those terrified and agony filled sounds, brought such a wave of shame over me I thought I might fall through the earth and shoot out the other side at such a speed I'd be launched into the void of space. I didn't fall but I did stumble over my own feet. <nl> My shoulder hit the wall and sent a picture to the ground, the one from our trip to Alaska all those years ago. We wanted to see the northern lights, but only saw a lot of grey clouds and snow. The glass pane shattered over our smiling faces sending specks of sharp glitter to the hardwood floor. Each tiny shine seemed to be a wailing siren that singled my existence like a beacon in the night. When everything settled I stood frozen again. Listening. Waiting. <nl> Nothing came. Not that night. And in the morning I saw them, their bodies, littering the nearly trimmed yards of the neighborhood, left behind like discarded scraps. I could see some of them from my window. Blood that clung to grass, the sidewalk, the street, caught the early morning light and gave a dull shine. Some patches looked fresh while others were dark and brown, dry or something close to it. Limbs lay scattered like confetti, parts I couldn't discern lay in heaps. Seeing the carnage I still worked up the courage to leave the house, somehow. I had to know it wasn't part of a prank, that it was real. I had to know. <nl> I tied a couple sheets together, and to my bed, pulling the knots tight before opening the window. If it didn't hold the fall wouldn't kill me, probably, but I'd have to get the ladder from the shed out back. The dark shed. If tunnels were bad would all dark places be, as well? I shook the question away, storing it for later and pushed the screen out of the windowsill. It landed with a small sound and I leaned over the edge. <nl> It held, my makeshift rope. And I reached the yard with aching shoulders. A body lay in my near my driveway. Rich tawny skin glowing in the golden sunlight, deep black hair spread out around a bloody face. Camilla Greer from two houses down lay on her back, her black dress slick and torn to rags over her stomach. Bile kissed my tongue when I saw she was hollowed out, her meat and organs gone without a trace. Then I noticed her arm, barely clinging to the rest of her body with only a string of muscle. <nl> A gasp left me, echoed by someone down the block. Mr. Lok. Omar. The richly colored robe he wore, red with gold accents, hung loosely around his body, the sash laying near the steps of his porch. The thick cloth dragged behind him, through the stained grass, catching a couple times on the rough sidewalk as he stumbled over the edge of the curb into the street. <nl> I heard his quick breaths before he emptied his stomach next to a piece of glistening gore, and I watched him wipe tears from his wrinkled face. I watched him and heard others, all around us, waking and leaving their homes, taking in the horror that stained the neighborhood, one renowned for its safety. I watched them all as they remembered the parting words of that news anchor, the words that slid through my mind. <nl> "Military aid is unavailable. Good luck." <nl> It wasn't a joke, it wasn't a prank. It was real, and no one was coming to save us. <eos>
