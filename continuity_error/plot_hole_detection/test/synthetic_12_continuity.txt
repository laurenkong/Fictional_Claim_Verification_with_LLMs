continuity 37
<sos> Blurry neon green wording flashed in my peripheral vision. <nl> > Objective: Pick up Claire <nl> I shot upright, sending a wave of empty beer cans tumbling onto the floor. <nl> > Time remaining, 6 minutes 34 seconds. <nl> "Shit. Shit shit shit!" I grabbed my pants and pulled them up, almost tripping as I hopped towards my tee-shirt. It was my weekend with Claire, and I'd screwed up again. Ever since I'd left the army, that was pretty much all I did. Screw up. That, and once screw a woman I shouldn't have. No, that was unfair. I wouldn't have Claire, if it wasn't for that drunken night. "Shit!" If I didn't get to her in six minutes, I wouldn't have Claire at all -- ever again. I was already teetering on the edge of a precipice. This would be all the ammunition Elena needed to get me out of Claire's life for good. <nl> "Shoes? Where are my shoes. Ah, come on." I scanned the floor, kicking over cans and clothes as I tried to unearth them. "Fuck it!" I grabbed my jacket and headed to the front door barefoot, slamming it behind me. <nl> > Time remaining 5 minutes and 46 seconds <nl> I pulled the door handle, but it didn't open. I tugged again, harder. A familiar feeling washed over me as I padded my pants and realised I'd put on the wrong pair. No car-keys. No house-keys. <nl> My eyes ran to the reflection of the once proud, but now hunched, bleary eyed man in the car window's reflection. <nl> > Health 18% <nl> It had been going down steadily since I'd left the army -- since the injury and the indignant dismal. Slowly, but steadily, it had been going down. But the gentle decline had evidently turned into a precipice: I'd lost 6% since last seeing my reflection. It was like the HUD knew what was going to happen. That I was going to lose my little girl forever. That life had defeated me in a way that no enemy I'd fought in the army every could. <nl> > Time remaining, 4 minutes 58 seconds. <nl> I sunk my head into the crook of my elbows as I leaned against the car and wept. "I'm so sorry, baby." <nl>Time remaining: -1 minute 13 seconds.<nl><nl> The sound of laughter made me look up. A little girl and her mother walked past the driveway. The sound reminded me of my little princess, that day on the park swing as I pushed her far higher than I wanted to. Far higher than any of the other children. But that's what *she* had wanted, and she'd loved every second of it. <nl> "Fuck it," I said, as I shrugged off my jacket. "Daddy's coming, baby!" I hurtled out of the drive and began to run, my barefeet slapping hard against the asphalt. <nl> > Time remaining, 3 minutes 26 seconds. <nl> It was at least a twenty minute walk to Elena's, and I hadn't run in years. Not like this, at any rate. Maybe to the off-license before it closed for another bottle of whatever shit I was in the mood for. I was barely down the street and could already feel my chest tightening. I avoided glancing in anything reflective for fear of my health. "Don't die, Chris," I panted. "Not today." <nl> > Time remaining, 2 minutes 3 seconds. <nl> In the bottom of my vision, a rectangular overlay tracked my progress with a single red dot. I was going too damn slow. I looked around, my reflection be damned. Up ahead, leaning against a wall outside a house, was a small yellow bike covered with colourful flower print. <nl> There was an indignant yell as I jumped on it and began peddling. <nl> "Sorry!" I replied. "I'll bring it back shortly!" <nl> > Time remaining, 0 minutes 13 seconds. <nl> The houses passed me by in a blur. I pumped the pedals as if I was back in the army gym. Back before it had all gone to shit. <nl> > Time remaining, 0 minutes 4 seconds. <nl> I steered the bike into the drive and hopped off it, letting it fall to the ground. There! Elena was outside her house watering the plants. I sprinted the last few steps towards her. <nl> "I-- I made it!" I gasped. "I made it! With two whole seconds to spare. Where is she, Elana? Where's my daughter?" <nl> Elena's face fell as she saw me. "Oh, Chris." She put the down the watering can. <nl> "Where is she, Elana?" I repeated. <nl> "Look at you... What happened this time?" <nl> "I want to see my daughter. Now!" I added sternly. <nl> "You're three hours late, Chris. And now she's out with her friends." <nl> I checked my hud. <nl> > Mission succesfull <nl> "Bullshit!" I said through gritted teeth. "That's utter bullshit. I was exactly on time." I tapped my head. "I can see it, you know. In here. You can't lie to me anymore." <nl> She sighed as her eyes welled. "Chris, please don't do this." <nl> "Do what, exactly? Fight for my little princess? Is that what you want -- me just to give up?" I laughed. "Of course it is." <nl> "For Christ's sake, she's seventeen, Chris. She's not your little princess anymore. And don't bring that HUD shit up. If the judge finds out that your're hallucinating again, you'll lose all contact with her -- regardless of what I want." <nl> My ears screeched. I clasped my hands over them as I stepped back. "No. No, no, no! This isn't right. This isn't right at all!" <nl> "Chris..." A hand touched my shoulder. I turned. <nl> > Markus, Elana's fiance. <nl> "Listen to me," he began. "You need help. For your daughter's sake, but also, for *your* sake. You know, she didn't want you to turn up today? She's fucking scared of you -- and can you blame her? Let us help you. I know this great doctor. He's dealt with the kind of head trauma that yo--" <nl> "No," I begged, as I fell to my knees. <nl> The hud began to fade as tears streaked my face. <nl> "Please, *no*. Not again. Not again. Not again. Not again." <eos>
