continuity 35
<sos> Ian always hated English class. It was rare for there to be anything that interested him. Most of the books were boring and the writing assignments were even more so. A four page essay about my spring break? I stayed at home watching TV and playing StarCraft, should I write about that? Uhg. <nl> While Ian internally complained and stared out the window, Mr. Smith was droning on about something. Ian didn't care, probably something dumb. He would ask Chris about it later. <nl> "... count on you, right Ian?" Mr. Smith said. <nl> Ian focused his attention towards him. Mr. Smith had his hands on the shoulders of a kid wearing a collared shirt and jeans. It also had a lizard face. Weird. Wait. <nl> "Excuse me, what the fuck," Ian said aloud as what he was seeing finally hit him. <nl> "Ian, watch your language! Are you going to help Mark get settled in or not? If you do I may forget the fact you just cursed in my classroom." <nl> Ian was still trying to wrap his head around this. He looked around the room and no one seemed to care. Some of his classmates were doodling, others casually looking in his direction. 'Mark' was looking right at him. Okay, I wanted to end my boredom but this is too damn much, he thought to himself. Think. No one else is responding to this, maybe it's a prank or... maybe you are hallucinating. Okay, I'll show him around, first top, nurses office. <nl> "I guess," Ian said still filled with doubt and worry. <nl> "Great. Chris, can you please make sure to give him a copy of your notes after class?" <nl> "Sure thing, Mr. Smith," Chris replied. <nl> "Alright, Ian get going. Come back when you are done." <nl> "Okay," Ian said while staring hard at Mark. <nl>Yep, there he goes," 'Mark' said as Ian lost consciousness. <nl> Ian woke up to the sound of his alarm going off. He sat up in bed, rubbing his eyes and trying to shake off the strange dream he had just experienced. <nl> 12#In the nurse's office, Mrs. Brooks took his temperature and it read 98, a bit low, but nothing to worry about. Why don't you go back to class for now, if you start to feel worse you can come back.<nl><nl> Ian got out of his desk and grabbed his bag. There was a part of him that wanted to look up and see some normal pimply face teenager staring back at him when he looked up again. <nl> No luck. Still a guy with a green head that resembled a Komodo dragon. <nl> Ian opened the door and held it for Mark who exited the classroom. <nl> Think, Ian, how do I figure this out. Shit. Wait. <nl> "So, where are you from?" Ian asked without looking at him. <nl> "You probably have never heard of it, it's pretty far away." He replied, his voice was raspy with a bit of lisp, but it was distinctly a North American English accent of some sort. Ian was never good at that stuff. Like he could tell if someone was from the south or the east coast but that's about it. <nl> "I see. Well, let's go to the nurse first I have to ask her a question, but here are the 2nd floor classrooms as you have already figured out. Any classroom with a 2... which now that I'm saying it, that's probably obvious." <nl> "A little," Mark said with an odd chortle. "Are you okay?" <nl> Fuck. The one question he didn't want this guy to ask. No, there are a million questions he didn't want him to ask. Keep it simple until you figure this out Ian. <nl> "Yeah, might be getting a cold or something." Ian replied. <nl> They descended the stairs to the first floor near the entry to the building. <nl> "Okay so down that way," Ian pointed behind the stairs, "are the A lockers and classrooms, mostly for freshman. And over that way, are the C lockers and the C classrooms and this way are B." Ian said this as he pointed down the halls where they were. <nl> "Got it." <nl> "And around this corner are all the administration crap, principal's office, nurse's office, all that shit. So give me a minute. I'll be back in a few." Ian said as he opened the door to the nurses office. <nl> Mrs. Brooks was sitting at her computer as he entered. She looked up, smiled and slid her chair into the open. <nl> "Hello, young man. Ian, right?" <nl> "Yes, ma'am." <nl> "What's wrong?" <nl> "I don't really know, I think I might have a fever or something. I was seeing weird stuff earlier." <nl> Please don't ask me. Please don't ask me. <nl> "That doesn't sound good. Let's take your temperature, though I must say you look perfectly fine." <nl> "Yeah, it just happened a bit ago. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't weird." <nl> She gave him a concerned, but puzzled look before handing him a thermometer. He put it in his mouth. Ian knew there was nothing wrong. Mark was a damned lizard person and he was the only one that could see it. This was some serious horror stuff going on. Lovecraft, King... something. <nl> A moment later the thermometer beeped. Mrs. Brooks took it. <nl> "98, a bit low, but nothing to worry about. Why don't you go back to class for now, if you start to feel worse you can come back." <nl> Figures. <nl> "Okay, thanks Mrs. Brooks." <nl> Ian left the office to see Mark sitting on a nearby chair in the hall. <nl> "Everything okay?" He asked. <nl> No, it's not, you still look like a damned lizard. <nl> "No. You are going to think this is nuts... but right now you look like a lizard person. I don't mean I think you are ugly or weird or something... like LITERALLY A LIZARD PERSON. I think I'm losing my mind." <nl> Mark chuckled. <nl> "Well, guess someone is losing their fucking job. Flarxal, did you hear that?.. No, I didn't authorize that yet... This was a long term mission, estimated ten earth years... No, EARTH YEARS... You what?.. For the love of... Well, sorry Ian. You weren't suppose to find out this way." Mark lifted his wrist and a holographic interface appeared. He did something to it and his face shifted to that of an almost generic high school student. Dark hair, roman nose, pimples all that. Then it reverted back. <nl> Ian was trying to wrap his head around this. What the actual fuck. He started to feel light headed. He fell backwards. <nl> "Yep, there he goes," 'Mark' said as Ian lost consciousness. <nl> *Continued below.* <eos>
