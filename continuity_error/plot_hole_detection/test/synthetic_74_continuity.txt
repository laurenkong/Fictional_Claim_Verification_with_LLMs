<sos> "God damn it, Life, come look at this!" <nl> Life sidled over to his sister. He then groaned in equal disgust; it was another book on the "relationship" between Life (him) and Death (Life's sister). <nl> "You know, I thought we got over this with the Chinese; I didn't mind being referred to as Yin and Yang, they didn't make it so sexual!" Life retorted. <nl>I can't believe Humor would pull a prank like this!" Life exclaimed, trying to suppress a grin.<nl><nl> "Things were supposed to be better when Atheism and Deism took precedence! But nooooo, those damn book publishing companies just haaaad to love this topic!" Death stomped her foot angrily. <nl> Life sighed. "Isn't their anyone who would believe the truth? I mean, whenever I go down to Earth in disguise, I always make it so someone gets knocked up somehow, UNINTENTIONALLY." <nl> "I know, and last time I went down there, some guy named Adolf- wait, Life, there's some mail from Humor. I asked him to look into this for me, since he's a bit easier with communication with the humans!" <nl> Life hesitated. "You trusted the man who brought 9/11 memes to the world with researching this for you....?" <nl> "Of course I did! He's trust worthy, right?" Death said, not hearing her brothers apprehension. "Humor knows how to talk to people, I figured he'd be able to- oh hey, it's an audio file. Alright let's just pull this up on the speaker....." <nl> And it was in that moment that Life knew what was about to play, his suspicions confirmed as "Sweet Home Alabama" played through out the room, mixed in with the laughter of Humor. <eos>
