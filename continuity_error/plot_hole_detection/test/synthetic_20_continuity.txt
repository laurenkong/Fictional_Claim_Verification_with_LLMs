<sos> As a nurse, I thought I knew pretty much everything there was to know about pain.  Not only from the perspective of my training, but thanks to my very unique and personal gift of being able to quantify pain into a discrete number.  It helps to a certain degree when it comes to triage and administering first aid; the complaining guy with the 1.2 over his head because he stubbed his toe hardly warrants my attention when there is a woman with a 37 over her head from the bulging spinal disc next door to him, despite her stoic demeanor. <nl> It is, admittedly, a little disappointing that I cannot turn off this ability.  No matter where I go, who I see, there's a number above their head.  For the most part I have learned to ignore it. <nl> That was until I met Gerald. <nl> I had just stepped onto my usual bus I take to work, and had sat down when I noticed the number floating above the head of the fellow in front of me.  I gasped:  800.  I'd never seen a number in the triple-digits before.  The highest I'd ever seen was a 73, and that number hovered over the head of someone who had been brought in after a house-fire, third-degree burns to 85% of his body.  And that 73 was already after the morphine he'd been given on the ambulance ride over.  He didn't survive, but in a way that was a blessing; it didn't take my ability to see the agony the poor man was in as he writhed upon the gurney as they wheeled him into the ER. <nl> I'd always kind of assumed that 100 was the most you could feel, based on my own experience.  I was sure that meant instant death, though I admit that doesn't always make sense; I watched many people with a 0.1 over their heads simply drop to the floor from a burst aneurysm.  Completely painless, but completely lethal.  But as far as pain goes?  I'm pretty sure 100 would be the end of you. <nl>I had always kind of assumed that 100 was the most you could feel, based on my own experience...<nl><nl> And yet there sat this man on the bus before me, reading the newspaper, 800 hovering over his head.  He looked perhaps late forties, early fifties tops, based on the grey in his otherwise brown hair, and I could see the ends of a pair of glasses over his ears.  Curiosity got the better of me, and I gently tapped him on the shoulder.  "Excuse me, sir?" <nl> "Hmm?" he turned, only mildly startled, and I was regarded by light brown eyes and the barest hint of a smile.  "Yes?" <nl> "Uh, sir, pardon the intrusion.  My name's Elanor, I'm a nurse at Central.  I know this is highly unusual, but... are you feeling okay?" <nl> "Gerald," he replied, and his expression didn't change.  "I suppose I am.  I don't feel sick, if that's what you mean." <nl> "Oh," I replied.  For a moment I sat in silence, searching his expression.  Gerald regarded me steadily.  "It's just that, well, part of my job is being able to assess people's level of pain.  And... well, sir, it seems yours is..." <nl> "I'm fine," Gerald interjected, the smile that was barely present disappearing entirely.  "I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine."  And with that, he turned back around and resumed reading the paper. <nl> I bit my lip, but I knew better than to try and press the issue.  He wasn't a patient, merely a stranger on a bus, and I had no authority to go any further.  But how I wanted to!  My gaze drifted up, and I watched with growing concern as the number crept up to 803.  What was going on here? <nl> I had reached my stop, and as I disembarked I cast a quick glance at Gerald.  All I saw was the newspaper in front of his face.  With a sigh, I made my to the hospital. <nl> The rest of the day was typical, though today was my long shift, not due to finish until 10 that night.  It was just after 9 that the ambulance arrived, siren blaring and lights flashing.  I had barely made it to the ER when the EMTs blasted through the doors with a gurney, a mostly lifeless body upon it.  But still alive, for a number still hovered above its head; once a person dies, that number vanishes.  And the number above this patient was 813. <nl> I stopped short, immediately robbed of breath, for two reasons.  One, I knew it was Gerald, for I recognized the same clothes he'd been wearing when he rode the bus.  And two, because that was the only way I could recognize him; his face was gone, a mess of obliterated bone and tissue with an ET tube poking out of it, and immediately I recognized the end result of a botched suicide by shotgun.  This injury isn't new to me.  The suicidal often try to take their own lives in this fashion, but with the effort of trying to reach the trigger with the end of the barrel jammed under their chin they end up tilting their head back, and the force of the blast does not go towards the brain, but instead up and forwards.  They often survive, sometimes only for a while, sometimes going on to have their face reconstructed by incredible surgeons who give them a second chance at life.  If they were lucky, they retained an eye or two, but many would go on to live blind. <nl> Gerald was still alive, but it seemed there would be no ability to see for him, as there was no sign of his eyes in the shredded mess of what used to be his face.  As I set up a second central line in Gerald's arm, hooking him up to the infusion pump that would at least temporarily keep him alive, I watched in horror as the number crept up to 829. <nl> As the rest of the team of doctors and nurses rushed to pump pain relief, antibiotics, and attach him to ECG and EEG, I had a moment to ask the first responding EMT Gerald's circumstances. <nl> "Neighbor phoned it in," was the response.  "Heard a single shot." <nl> "Family?" I inquired.  The EMT shook his head. <nl> "He lived alone, apparently." <nl> And that's all there was time for before people scattered to their respective duties.  If there was no immediate family living with Gerald, that meant any existing family would need to be found and alerted to the situation, and what would come next depended on whether Gerald had a living will.  In the meantime, we were obligated to keep him alive. <nl> But as I watched the number above his head creep to 836, I was not sure that was the right path to take... <eos>
