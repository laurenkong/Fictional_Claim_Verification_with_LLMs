<sos> Shaggy feels the heat of a dying universe against his skin. He takes it in, knowing that the existence of all things is just a cycle. Soon the drivers of the cycle would notice him, as they do at the the end of each universe Shaggy has witnessed previously. The final battle would take place as usual and he would win. but this time, it felt different. <nl>Wait... Did I forget something?"<nl><nl> " wait... one's still here?" The Drivers had gathered in galactic space, their forms the size of unfathomable stars, and Shaggy felt their attention be drawn to him. <nl> "Like, let's just get this over with , man" <nl> The Drivers flare in anger, the begin their assault. In unison, they send their energy flowing to the small, thin figure hovering in space. The power reaches Shaggy, who had been calmly watching it approach. He catches it. The Drivers recoil in astonishment, then in fear as they realise they were never at the top of the great chain of being. <nl> " Like, That was all you got? I bare - <nl> Shaggy is cut off, the Drivers had just been annihilated by a blinding flash of light. At 0.001 percent power, Shaggy is stunned, he faintly hears what he thinks is a trumpet solo begin, then the words <nl> " We are number one, We are number one" <nl> Shaggy realises this is no ordinary cycle. His eyes snap open as his power level is increased. And in front of him is the man himself. Forever Number One, Robbie Rotten, he goes by many names. He gives a smile then speaks. His lips do not move, but he sends his voice through the cosmos. <nl> " O, How many universes I have travelled through to seek you. You may be the worthy opponent I have been seeking this whole time." <nl> Shaggy smiles, sensing his power, he had finally found someone who may be worth anything above his 1 percent. <nl> "Like, whoever you are, I've been waiting for this fight throughout my whole existence. " <nl> And with anticipation surpassing what Shaggy could muster when consuming a Scooby Snack, the battle of legends commenced. <eos>
