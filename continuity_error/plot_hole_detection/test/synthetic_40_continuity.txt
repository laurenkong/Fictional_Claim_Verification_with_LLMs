<sos> "Listen, Jim, we need to *talk*," said my darling wife, standing atop a burning orphanage. She was wearing her full ruby red getup, impervious to the flames licking towards the sky. Her hands were on her hips. And she'd had that *look*. <nl>I always do," she said, her eyes simmering with pleasure. <nl> "I always do," she said, her eyes simmering with pleasure. <nl><nl> *Oh boy, here we go.* <nl> I ran full speed through the brick, eyes burning through the smoke. The little orphans gathered around, and I swept their smoke-streaked faces under my arms as if I was giving them a big bear hug. <nl> "Hun, if this is about inviting the boys over..." <nl> She materialized in the flames before me, face alight in pure, burning rage. The kids in my arms shrieked. <nl> "No, not that--I wanted to talk about the other night." <nl> Without a second thought, I tucked the children under my arm like a running back and stiff-armed my way through the living room wall. The children under my arm squirmed and coughed. <nl> *Shit*. *Gotta get them out of the smoke*.  "The other night?" I asked. <nl> I opened the door to the kitchen, and my wife burst towards us inside of a massive fireball. "You don't even remember?!" she shrieked. She nearly singed off my eyebrows. <nl> *Christ almighty, she was insatiable.* <nl> I slammed the door right in her face, blisters already forming along the length of my arm. *So...not that way then.* <nl> "I'm sorry hun, I have no idea what you're talking about. We just watched TV all night, right?" <nl> No going the way I'd first entered either. It was already engulfed in flames. Whatever I'd done, it must have been bad. I felt the heat of her anger rising, to the point where the entire orphanage felt like a damned furnace. <nl> "Yeah, and when I asked if you wanted to go for a bike ride, you told me 'no'," came her voice from somewhere in the coiling smoke. <nl> It filtered through my nostrils, squeezing the life out of my lungs. "Yeah...?" I coughed. <nl> *Neeeeed. Aiiiiiiir*. <nl> "Well, I was offended by your tone." <nl> My mind whirred. The smoke was making me delirious. It was hard to make sense of just what the hell she was even trying to say. <nl> "My tone? I'm sorry hun, I just wanted to watch *Survivor*." <nl> I walked towards a window, aiming to burst through and save these poor kids, but as I rumbled towards it I felt the ceiling above me quiver. With milliseconds to spare, I dodged out of the way with inhuman strength as the living room ceiling collapsed in a pile of glowing red timber. <nl> We fell in a pile of coughs and screams. I double checked the children. They seemed to be okay. Woozy, sure, and one *might* have been passed out. But otherwise fine. <nl> "Yes! Your tone. It was *rude*." <nl> Through the newfound hole in the ceiling, I made out a blue patch of sky. There. A *lifeline*. <nl> All I had to do was... <nl> "Listen, hun, I'm sorry. I mean it. I'd had a long day--you of all people should know--the last thing I'd meant was to be rude." <nl> As I leaped towards salvation, the flames reached out and snagged me. I cried out in pain as the fire singed my ankles, and I fell back into the burning building with a sickening *thud.* <nl> The children were still tucked away safely, though. I'd been a football star in highschool. No way was I fumbling the Duke. <nl> The flames parted around my wife as she walked up for the killshot. "I know you didn't *mean* it." Or maybe even, "Well, next time *think* before you speak." <nl> But I knew just how to cut her off. <nl> I stood up with my most apologetic face. "You're the love of my life," I said. "You know I'd never want to hurt you." <nl> Then I punched her square in the gut. <nl> She flew back, arms flailing, colliding with the wall and crumbling into a heap amidst all that smoke. "Really?" she croaked. "It's just...you know. I don't want this to turn into another Bruce situation." <nl> *And boom goes the dynamite.* <nl> The root of all our problems--as few and far between as they were--related back to her previous marriage. She'd told me she and Bruce had lost their passion somewhere along the line. At a certain point, he'd just retired to his *cave*--as she called it. They hardly ever did anything *fun*. <nl> "Babe," I said. "We've talked about this. You and Bruce weren't connected by Fate. You just...I don't know...didn't *fit*." <nl> I swooped her up in my free arm. <nl> "You and I on the other hand--well, just take a look around you." <nl> She collapsed with a smile as she examined the pure carnage. <nl> An entire orphanage, churning into ash. <nl> "You always know just what to say to vanquish me." <nl> Beneath my arms, the little orphans groaned. <nl> "I love you so much," I said, kissing my wife on her forehead. "Now, let's take you to jail." <nl> The police waited outside. <nl> They thanked me profusely as they took her into custody. She waved from the squad car as she was hauled away. <nl> "Will you make it home by dinner?" I asked as she passed. <nl> "I always do," she said, her eyes simmering with pleasure. <nl> I puffed my chest as, beside me, the paramedics had arrived to see to the children's burns. Most of the little youngsters were crying hysterically, anxiously rubbing ash from their eyes. <nl> "Let that be a lesson," I said in my most paternal tone. "It's *always* best to talk things out." <nl> --------- <nl> r/M0zark <eos>
