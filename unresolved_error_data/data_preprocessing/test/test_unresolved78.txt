It was a rainy evening when Mrs. Seton burst into Martin Hewitt's office, her eyes wide with fear and desperation. "Mr. Hewitt, please help me," she implored. "My son, Charley, he's gone missing. I don't know where he is!"

Martin Hewitt, a seasoned investigator known for his keen eye and sharp mind, listened intently as Mrs. Seton recounted the events leading up to Charley's disappearance. The young boy had vanished from their home without a trace, leaving his mother frantic with worry. Hewitt assured Mrs. Seton that he would do everything in his power to find her son.

As he began his investigation, Hewitt quickly discovered that there was more to Charley's disappearance than met the eye. The trail led him to Mrs. Isitt, a troubled woman living in the same neighborhood. Mrs. Isitt's husband, a once-prominent doctor, had fallen into a deep state of insanity, leaving her struggling to cope with his erratic behavior and the toll it took on their family.
