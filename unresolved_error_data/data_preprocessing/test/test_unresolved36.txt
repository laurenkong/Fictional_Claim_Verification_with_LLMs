Mr. John Duff, a seasoned Scottish commercial traveller, found himself in the heart of London on a chilly autumn evening. His business trip had brought him to the bustling city, where he hoped to secure new trade deals for his company. Little did he know that this trip would lead him into a web of intrigue and danger.

One evening at his hotel, Mr. Duff encountered an affable American named Risdom Tillstone in the smoking room. The two struck up a conversation, and soon a friendship began to blossom. Tillstone, with his pleasant demeanor and charming personality, quickly won over Mr. Duff's trust.

As their friendship deepened, Mr. Duff noticed a peculiar small yellow star with a blue ribbon that Tillstone always wore discreetly pinned to his coat. Initially dismissing it as a mere trinket, Mr. Duff's curiosity was piqued when he observed Tillstone's evasive behavior whenever the star was mentioned.

Strange incidents began to unfold around them - mysterious thefts and unsettling disappearances that seemed to be linked to the enigmatic yellow star that Tillstone carried. As Mr. Duff's suspicions grew, he couldn't shake the feeling that Tillstone was somehow involved in a sinister organization known as the Yellow Star League.

Determined to uncover the truth, Mr. Duff sought the help of detective Tyler Tatlock, a renowned investigator known for his sharp mind and keen wit. Together, they delved into the murky world of the Yellow Star League, connecting the dots between the thefts, the abduction, and the secretive activities of the criminal network.

Through clever deductions and careful planning, Tatlock and Mr. Duff unraveled the intricate web of the Yellow Star League's operations.
