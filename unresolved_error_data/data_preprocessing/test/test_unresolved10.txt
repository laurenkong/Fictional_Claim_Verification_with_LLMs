It was a foggy morning in London when Dr. Sterndale, a renowned African explorer, arrived at 221B Baker Street seeking the help of Sherlock Holmes. His rugged appearance and determined expression hinted at a troubled mind, and Holmes immediately sensed that this was no ordinary case.

As they sat in Holmes' study, Dr. Sterndale revealed the reason for his visit. He spoke of the Tregennis family, once a respected and happy household, now torn apart by a tragic event. Three siblings - Mortimer, George, and Brenda Tregennis - had been found in their sitting room in a state of madness, with Brenda dead from an apparent overdose of devil's-foot root, a rare and deadly poison found only in Africa.

Dr. Sterndale confessed to Holmes that he had been deeply in love with Brenda Tregennis, but their love was forbidden due to legal constraints. Desperate and consumed by his emotions, he had taken matters into his own hands to ensure that Brenda would be free to be with him.
