Limmis was a quiet, unassuming young man who lived a mundane life as a bookstore clerk by day and a passionate artist by night. He had always been drawn to the quiet beauty of Richmond Park, finding solace in its peaceful surroundings as he sketched and painted the serene landscapes. Little did he know that one fateful evening would change his life forever.

It was a chilly autumn night when Limmis decided to take a stroll through the park, seeking inspiration for his latest painting. As he wandered through the winding paths, the sound of rustling leaves and distant bird calls filled the air. Suddenly, a piercing scream shattered the tranquility, causing Limmis to freeze in place.

Curiosity and concern propelled him forward, leading him to a clearing where a gruesome sight awaited him. A young woman lay motionless on the ground, a pool of blood staining the fallen leaves around her. Shocked and horrified, Limmis realized he had stumbled upon a murder scene.
