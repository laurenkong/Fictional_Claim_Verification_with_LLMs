It was a chilly evening in London when Sherlock Holmes received a peculiar visit from a distressed woman named Elsie Cubitt. She was in a state of shock and fear, her eyes pleading for help as she recounted the strange events that had unfolded in her life. Her husband, Hilton Cubitt, had been shot dead in their home, and she herself had narrowly escaped an attempt on her life.
