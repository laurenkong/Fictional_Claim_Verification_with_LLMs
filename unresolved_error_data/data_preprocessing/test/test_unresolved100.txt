It was a crisp autumn morning when Martin Hewitt received a peculiar request from a local constable to assist in a case involving illicit distilling. The small town of Oakwood had been abuzz with rumors of a secret operation producing illegal spirits, and the constabulary had finally managed to uncover the location of the distilling ring. Hewitt, intrigued by the challenge, set out to investigate the matter further.

Upon arrival at the site of the distillery, Hewitt's sharp eyes immediately noted the subtle signs of clandestine activity. The nursery, located at the outskirts of town, appeared innocent enough on the surface, but Hewitt sensed there was more to it than met the eye. With his trusty assistant by his side, they began a thorough examination of the nursery, carefully inspecting each corner and crevice for any clues that might lead them to the heart of the operation.

After hours of meticulous searching, Hewitt's assistant stumbled upon a hidden trapdoor beneath a rug in the greenhouse. Without hesitation, they opened the trapdoor and descended into a dark, damp cellar below. What they found was beyond their wildest expectationsâ€”a fully functioning distillery, complete with copper stills, barrels of fermenting mash, and shelves lined with bottles of illicit spirits.

As they explored the cellar, Hewitt's keen observations revealed the intricacies of the operation. It became clear that Samuel Geldard, a wealthy but unassuming nursery owner, was the mastermind behind the distilling ring.
