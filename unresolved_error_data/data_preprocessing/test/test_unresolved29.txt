The sun was setting, casting a warm golden glow over Berkly Manor as Eric Neville paddled his canoe back to shore after a relaxing day on the river. The gentle lapping of the water against the side of his boat soothed his mind, and he felt a sense of peace wash over him. However, as he approached the grand manor house, a sense of unease began to settle in the pit of his stomach.

Docking his canoe, Eric made his way up the path towards the house. The air was heavy with the scent of summer flowers, but there was an underlying tension in the atmosphere that Eric couldn't quite shake off. Pushing open the heavy oak door, he entered the grand foyer of Berkly Manor.

It was then that he heard the commotion coming from his uncle's study. Heart pounding, Eric rushed towards the source of the noise, only to be met with a scene of horror. His uncle, Squire Neville, lay lifeless on the floor, a pool of blood spreading around his head. The gun lay nearby, still smoking from the fatal shot.

Shock and disbelief washed over Eric as he knelt beside his uncle's body. He had left him just a few hours ago, alive and well. How could this have happened?

As the local constable, Wardle, arrived on the scene and suspicion began to fall on Eric, a London detective by the name of Mr. Beck was called in to investigate. Mr. Beck was known for his sharp mind and relentless questioning, and he wasted no time in delving into the details of the case.

The evidence seemed damning against Eric. He had a heated quarrel with his uncle the night before, witnessed by the butler and his cousin John. He was the one to discover the body, and his presence in the room immediately after the murder raised eyebrows.

During the inquest, Mr. Beck's astute questioning began to unravel a web of deceit and hidden motives within the walls of Berkly Manor. He probed into Eric's relationship with his uncle, his financial situation, and his whereabouts during the time of the murder. Each question seemed to paint a darker picture of Eric's involvement in the crime.
