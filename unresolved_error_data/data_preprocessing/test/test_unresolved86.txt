Detective James Wigan stood in the dimly lit study of the late Mr. Seligmann's home, his mind racing with questions and suspicions. The gruesome wounds on the wealthy German's body told a tale of violence and betrayal, but the true culprit remained elusive. Beside him, the eccentric Professor Quarles and his assistant, Wigan, were deep in conversation, their sharp minds already at work unraveling the mystery.

As they delved deeper into the case, the spotlight of suspicion fell on various acquaintances of Mr. Seligmann. The famous Hungarian dancer, Miss Wickham, whose veiled presence at the opera raised eyebrows. The Honorable Percival Marsh, whose connections to the victim seemed murky at best. Each individual seemed to hide a motive, a secret that could potentially unravel the tangled web of deceit surrounding the murder.

However, as the investigation progressed, a new player emerged onto the scene - Mrs. Seligmann, the wife of the deceased. Despite her initial grief and shock at her husband's death, there was a darkness in her eyes that did not escape the keen observation of Detective Wigan. It soon became evident that she harbored a dark secret, one that could potentially hold the key to solving the case.

With the help of Professor Quarles and his unorthodox methods, the team began piecing together the intricate puzzle of lies and deceit that surrounded Mr. Seligmann's murder. Clues were unearthed, alibis questioned, and the true nature of each suspect was laid bare under the relentless scrutiny of the detective and his companions.

As the investigation reached its climax, a shocking revelation came to light - Mrs. Seligmann was not the grieving widow she appeared to be. Her dark secret, once hidden in the shadows, now stood exposed for all to see. The lines between madness and primal instinct blurred as the true nature of the culprit was revealed, painting a chilling portrait of human nature at its most raw and unforgiving.
