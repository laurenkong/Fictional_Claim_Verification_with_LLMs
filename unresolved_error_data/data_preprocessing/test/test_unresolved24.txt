It was a cold and dreary day when Thorndyke received the urgent call from Mr. Edward Stopford. The solicitor's voice trembled over the phone as he explained the dire situation he found himself in. A woman had been brutally murdered in a railway carriage, and all evidence pointed towards him as the prime suspect.

Without hesitation, Thorndyke enlisted the help of his colleague, Jervis, and together they set out to defend Mr. Stopford. As they delved into the details of the case, it became clear that the odds were stacked against them. The police were convinced of Mr. Stopford's guilt, and the public outcry for justice was deafening.

Undeterred, Thorndyke and Jervis began their investigation. They visited the crime scene, meticulously examining every inch of the railway carriage where the murder had taken place. Thorndyke's keen eye picked up on subtle details that others had overlooked, and slowly but surely, a different picture began to emerge.

Their next stop was the mortuary, where they conducted a thorough examination of the victim's body. Thorndyke's precise observations led to the discovery of crucial evidence that would later prove to be a turning point in the case.

As they pieced together the timeline of events leading up to the woman's death, Thorndyke's mind worked tirelessly, analyzing every piece of information and forming a theory that would soon shatter the assumptions made by the police and the public.

With a clever reconstruction of the events that transpired in the railway carriage, Thorndyke presented his findings to the court. He painted a picture of a tragic accident, a series of unfortunate circumstances that had led to the woman's untimely demise.

The courtroom held its breath as Thorndyke laid out his case, methodically presenting the evidence that pointed towards a different conclusion than the one everyone had expected.
