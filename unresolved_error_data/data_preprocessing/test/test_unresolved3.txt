The afternoon sun cast a warm glow through the dusty windows of the pawnbroker's shop, illuminating the chaos that had erupted within. Professor Kennedy, a renowned forensic expert known for his sharp mind and keen eye for detail, stood amidst the commotion, his brow furrowed in concentration as he surveyed the scene before him.

In one corner, Mrs. Moulton, the shop owner's wife, stood with tears streaming down her face, her hands clasped in a gesture of desperation. "I confess, I confess!" she cried, her voice trembling with emotion.

Professor Kennedy's keen ears caught her words, and he turned his attention to her with a look of intense curiosity. As she spoke, the pieces of the puzzle began to fall into place. Mrs. Moulton revealed the tangled web of deceit and crime that had ensnared her husband, Lynn Moulton, in a scheme of theft and deception.

With a sense of urgency, Professor Kennedy sprang into action. He knew that time was of the essence if they were to uncover the truth behind the series of robberies that had plagued the town. Using his forensic skills, he carefully examined the evidence scattered around the shop, piecing together the intricate details of the crime.

As he studied the safe that had been the target of the robberies, Professor Kennedy noticed a faint but distinct forehead-print on its surface. With a sense of determination, he dusted the print for further analysis, his heart racing with the anticipation of what he might uncover.
