Dr. Stewart sat in his study, the crackling fire casting flickering shadows on the walls. The room was filled with the familiar scent of old books and burning wood. He sipped his scotch, the golden liquid warming him from the inside as he waited for his friend, Alan Collingswood, to arrive.

"Alan, what's happened?" Dr. Stewart asked, guiding his friend to a chair by the fire.

Dr. Stewart leaned in closer, his eyes widening in disbelief.
