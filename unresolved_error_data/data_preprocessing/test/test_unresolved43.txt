Mr. Carlyle, a renowned private inquiry agent in London, sat at his desk, contemplating the stack of cases in front of him. His keen mind and sharp eye for detail had solved countless mysteries over the years, but one particular case caught his attentionâ€”a valuable pearl necklace belonging to the Hon. Mrs. Straithwaite had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.

As he pondered the details of the case, a knock on the door interrupted his thoughts. In walked Max Carrados, his blind friend and confidant. Despite his lack of sight, Carrados possessed an extraordinary ability to perceive details through his other senses, making him a valuable asset in their investigations.

"Max, I have a case that I believe will pique your interest," Carlyle began, filling his friend in on the mysterious disappearance of the pearl necklace at the opera house during a lavish performance.

Carrados's interest was immediately piqued. With his acute sense of hearing and intuition, he was eager to delve into the complexities of the case alongside Carlyle.
