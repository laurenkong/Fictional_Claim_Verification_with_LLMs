The steam train screeched to a halt at Suberton Junction, its wheels grinding against the tracks as passengers disembarked onto the platform. Among the crowd, Detective Mr. Beck stood, his sharp eyes scanning the faces of those exiting the train. He had been called in to investigate a mysterious death that had occurred on board during the journey.

As the last of the passengers shuffled past, Beck's gaze fell upon the lifeless body of a man slumped in a corner of one of the passenger cars. The victim, later identified as Mr. Edward Malwood, had a deep gash on his forehead and a look of frozen horror etched on his face.

Beck wasted no time in securing the area and examining the scene. Clues were scarce, but he noticed a torn piece of fabric clutched in the dead man's hand. It bore the initials "A.M.," pointing to the victim's nephew, Albert Malwood, as a person of interest.

Determined to unravel the mystery, Beck delved into the Malwood family history, uncovering a web of secrets and strained relationships.
