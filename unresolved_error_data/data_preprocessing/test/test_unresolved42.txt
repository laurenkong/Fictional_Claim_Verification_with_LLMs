Eugène Valmont, a distinguished private detective with a reputation for solving the most perplexing cases, sat in his office sipping his morning coffee. As he perused the latest issue of Le Matin, his secretary informed him of a potential client waiting in the reception area. Valmont raised an eyebrow in mild curiosity, wondering what sort of case awaited him.

The client turned out to be Bentham Gibbes, a pickle manufacturer with a look of distress on his face. Gibbes launched into his tale of woe, detailing how a packet of money had gone missing from his dinner party the night before. Valmont listened with polite disinterest, not one to be easily swayed by tales of petty theft.

As Gibbes continued, he mentioned a peculiar clue that caught Valmont's attention—the mention of silver spoons. Intrigued by the seemingly innocuous detail, Valmont's interest was piqued. He agreed to take on the case, more out of curiosity than anything else.

Valmont decided to start his investigation by interviewing the guests who had attended Gibbes' dinner party. Among them was Vincent Innis, a charming but enigmatic man with a penchant for collecting curiosities. Valmont observed Innis closely, noting his subtle gestures and expressions as they conversed.

With the guidance of another guest, Lionel Dacre, Valmont began to piece together the puzzle. Dacre, a keen observer himself, pointed out several instances where Innis had exhibited suspicious behavior during the dinner party. Valmont's deductive skills went to work, connecting the dots and unraveling the mystery bit by bit.
