It was a crisp autumn evening when Sherlock Holmes received a frantic visit from Percy Phelps, a young government clerk, who was in a state of utter distress. The naval treaty, a document of utmost importance, had been stolen from his possession, and he was on the brink of ruin. Holmes, ever the astute detective, listened intently as Percy recounted the events leading up to the theft.

After gathering all the necessary details from Percy, Holmes delved into his investigation with fervor. He meticulously examined the scene of the crime, searching for any clues that could lead him to the perpetrator. His keen observation skills and sharp deductive reasoning were put to the test as he pieced together the puzzle of the stolen treaty.

Days turned into nights as Holmes tirelessly pursued every lead, following a trail of breadcrumbs that eventually led him to Joseph Harrison, a former acquaintance of Percy's who had fallen on hard times. Suspicions began to swirl around Joseph, whose sudden acquisition of wealth raised eyebrows in the close-knit community.

Holmes decided to conduct a night of surveillance at Joseph's residence, determined to catch the culprit in the act. As the moon hung high in the sky, Holmes hid in the shadows, patiently waiting for any sign of suspicious activity. The hours crept by slowly, but just as Holmes was beginning to feel the weight of fatigue, movement stirred in the darkness.

Joseph Harrison emerged from his house, a furtive look in his eyes as he made his way to a hidden compartment in the wall.
