Professor Kennedy sat at his desk, engrossed in a book on forensic psychology, when his assistant, Walter, brought in the day's mail. Among the usual assortment of letters and flyers, there was one that caught Kennedy's attention. It was a plea for help from a woman named Janet Cranston, who claimed to be held against her will in a private asylum called Belleclaire Sanatorium.

Kennedy's curiosity was piqued. He read the letter carefully, noting the desperation in the woman's words and the urgency of her situation. Without hesitation, he decided to take up the case and investigate the mysterious goings-on at Belleclaire Sanatorium.

Walter was skeptical at first, but he trusted Kennedy's instincts and agreed to assist him in the daring rescue mission. They made preparations, gathering their tools and equipment, including the phonometer—a device Kennedy had invented to detect and evade surveillance.

As they arrived at Belleclaire Sanatorium under the guise of potential patients seeking treatment, they immediately sensed something amiss. The staff seemed overly attentive, and the patients appeared subdued and fearful. Kennedy and Walter knew they had to tread carefully to avoid arousing suspicion.

Pretending to be interested in the services offered by the sanatorium, Kennedy and Walter managed to gain access to the facilities. They quickly realized that the institution was not what it seemed—it was a front for a nefarious scheme orchestrated by Janet's husband, Roger Cranston, and the head of the institution, Doctor Bolton Burr.

Through discreet inquiries and clever sleuthing, Kennedy and Walter uncovered the truth behind Janet's captivity.
