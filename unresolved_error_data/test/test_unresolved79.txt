The streets of Liverpool buzzed with activity as the news of the daring robbery at Mr. Schwarz's jeweller's shop spread like wildfire. The young jeweller had been a rising star in the city, known for his exquisite craftsmanship and impeccable reputation. Now, his name was tarnished, his shop ransacked, and Â£10,500 worth of jewels and money stolen.

Suspicions immediately fell on the Russian prince, Prince Semionicz, and his secretary, M. Lambert, who had been seen in the vicinity of the shop around the time of the robbery. The authorities believed that their lavish lifestyle and dubious connections made them prime suspects in the case. However, as Inspector Thompson delved deeper into the investigation, he began to unravel a web of deceit and betrayal that led him to an unexpected culprit.

It was during one of his routine interviews with the staff at Schwarz's shop that Inspector Thompson's attention was drawn to Mr. Vassall, a junior partner in the firm. Vassall's nervous demeanor and evasive answers piqued the inspector's interest, and he decided to dig deeper into the young man's background.

As Inspector Thompson delved into Vassall's financial records, a troubling pattern emerged. Vassall was drowning in debt, his extravagant lifestyle far exceeding his modest income. It became clear to the inspector that Vassall's financial troubles had driven him to desperate measures, leading him to orchestrate the elaborate robbery at Schwarz's shop.

With this new information in hand, Inspector Thompson confronted Vassall at his home late one evening. The young man's facade of innocence crumbled under the weight of the evidence against him, and he confessed to his role in the robbery.
