Belmore Park was abuzz with excitement as aviator Charles Norton prepared for his groundbreaking flight in his gyroscope-equipped machine. The park was packed with spectators eager to witness the historic event. Among the crowd was Kennedy, a seasoned investigator known for his keen eye and sharp intuition.

Kennedy had been called in to look into a series of mysterious aeroplane accidents that had been plaguing Belmore Park. There seemed to be no logical explanation for the crashes, and Kennedy suspected foul play. As Norton made his final preparations, Kennedy couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.

As Norton took to the skies in his gyroscopic aircraft, Kennedy began his investigation. He started by interviewing witnesses and examining the wreckage of the previous accidents. There were no signs of mechanical failure or pilot error, leading Kennedy to believe that someone was intentionally causing the crashes.

Through his inquiries, Kennedy learned of a man named Lamar who had been seen lurking around the park in the days leading up to the accidents. Lamar had introduced himself as Dr. K. Lamar, a scientist interested in studying aeroplane technology. However, Kennedy's instincts told him that Lamar's intentions were far from scientific.
