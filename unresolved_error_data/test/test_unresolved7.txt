Captain Hank Barber stood on the dock, his eyes widening in shock as he watched a motor boat careen into Boston Harbour, crashing into the dock with a loud thud. Rushing over, he was met with a grisly sight - a dead man in a French naval uniform slumped over the wheel of the boat.

Detective Mallory and Dr. Clough were called to the scene, but the case proved to be a puzzling one.

Through a series of meticulous observations and deductions, The Thinking Machine soon uncovered a web of deceit and betrayal surrounding Langham Dudley.
