It was a crisp autumn morning when Mr. James M. Dodd arrived at 221B Baker Street, desperate for Sherlock Holmes' help in unraveling the enigma surrounding his friend, Godfrey Emsworth. Dodd's distress was evident as he relayed the peculiar circumstances that had befallen Godfrey, prompting Holmes to take up the case with his usual tenacity and keen observation.

As Holmes delved into the details provided by Dodd, he noted the peculiarities of Godfrey's seclusion in an outhouse on his father's estate. The possibilities of crime, madness, or disease loomed large in Holmes' mind as he began to piece together the puzzle. His deductive reasoning led him to consider all angles of the situation, analyzing every clue with meticulous precision.

After careful investigation and contemplation, Holmes arrived at a startling conclusion - leprosy. The mere mention of the word sent a shiver down Dodd's spine, his concern for his friend deepening at the thought of such a devastating disease. Determined to uncover the truth and provide answers to Dodd and Godfrey's family, Holmes set out to confirm his suspicions.

With a stroke of genius, Holmes sought the expertise of renowned dermatologist, Sir James Saunders. Together, Holmes and Sir James embarked on a journey to the Emsworth estate, where the truth behind Godfrey's seclusion would finally be revealed. The collaboration between the master detective and the esteemed doctor promised a resolution to the mystery that had gripped all those involved.

Upon their arrival at Tuxbury Old Park, Colonel Emsworth greeted them with a mix of suspicion and apprehension. Holmes wasted no time in presenting his findings and requesting to see Godfrey. The tension in the air was palpable as they made their way to the outhouse where Godfrey had been confined.

As they entered the dimly lit space, Godfrey's figure came into view, his pale and gaunt appearance confirming Holmes' suspicions. A sense of relief washed over Dodd as he saw his friend, though the truth behind Godfrey's condition was yet to be fully understood.

Sir James Saunders, with his expert knowledge, examined Godfrey carefully.
