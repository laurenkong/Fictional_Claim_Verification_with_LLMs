Kennedy received a call late one evening from Andrews, the head of the insurance company, about a case that had piqued his interest. Montague Phelps, a wealthy man, had been found in a comatose state with no clear cause. Andrews suspected foul play and handed Kennedy a mysterious letter that hinted at deception in Phelps' death.

Intrigued by the case, Kennedy wasted no time in diving into the investigation. He visited the Phelps mausoleum, where he discovered human blood stains that raised suspicions of foul play. Furthermore, X-ray evidence suggested a possible attempt at suspended animation, leading Kennedy to consider the possibility that Phelps may have faked his own death.

As Kennedy delved deeper into the case, he uncovered a complex web of deception and intrigue surrounding Phelps and those close to him. It became apparent that there were hidden motives and dark secrets at play, driving the mystery deeper.

Just as Kennedy was beginning to piece together the puzzle, a dramatic turn of events shocked everyone involved.
