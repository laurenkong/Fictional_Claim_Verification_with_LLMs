The Rovigno country house had always been a place of elegance and tranquility, nestled in the rolling hills of the countryside. However, on the night of the fire, the peaceful atmosphere was shattered by flames that licked the sky and sent thick smoke billowing into the air. Kennedy and Jameson, two seasoned detectives known for their sharp wit and unyielding determination, arrived at the scene soon after the alarm was raised.

As they surveyed the charred remains of the once-grand estate, Kennedy's keen eyes caught sight of a peculiar device among the debrisâ€”an infernal machine, designed to cause destruction and chaos. Jameson, always the more cautious of the two, immediately sensed that this fire was no accident.

Their suspicions deepened when they learned that the Rovigno family had been involved in wireless communication experiments, and that Count Rovigno himself was a known advocate for American intervention in the war raging across the seas. The pieces of the puzzle began to fall into place as they uncovered a sinister plot to disrupt American neutrality by aiding in the escape of interned ships.

Their investigation led them to the docks, where the luxurious yacht Furious was being prepared for a clandestine mission. With the help of the secret service, Kennedy and Jameson infiltrated the operation, discovering a hidden compartment filled with communication devices and coded messages.
