Frances Wilton had been battling with her addiction to morphia for years, sinking deeper and deeper into its clutches until she reached her lowest point. Desperate to break free from the chains of her dependence, she sought out the help of Dr. Halifax, a renowned physician known for his unorthodox but effective methods of treating addiction.

Dr. Halifax took on Frances' case with determination and compassion, knowing the uphill battle she faced in overcoming her addiction. He devised a clever treatment plan that involved substituting morphia with strychnine, a potent tonic that mimicked some of the effects of the drug but without the addictive properties.
