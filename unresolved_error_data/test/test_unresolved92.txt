On a cold and foggy morning in the small town of Flaxton, Tyler Tatlock, a seasoned investigator known for his sharp mind and unwavering determination, received a call that would change the course of his career. Mr. George Graveling, a wealthy bookmaker in town, had been found dead on Flaxton Moor under suspicious circumstances. Tatlock wasted no time in heading to the scene of the crime, his mind already racing with possibilities and theories.

As Tatlock arrived at Flaxton Moor, he was met with a grim sight. The body of Mr. Graveling lay sprawled on the ground, his lifeless eyes staring up at the overcast sky. The local authorities were already on the scene, but Tatlock could sense that there was more to this case than met the eye. He immediately set to work, meticulously examining the area for any clues or evidence that could shed light on the mysterious death.

Through his investigation, Tatlock discovered that Mr. Graveling had been recently involved in a bitter divorce with his ex-wife, Selina Howells. Rumors circulated in town that Selina had harbored deep resentment towards Graveling and had been seen arguing with him in public on several occasions.
