It was a stormy night when Kennedy and Walter received a frantic phone call from Mrs. Amelia Fletcher, the wife of the late steel magnate John G. Fletcher. She informed them of her husband's sudden death and the disappearance of his will, which had been signed just days before his passing. Intrigued by the mysterious circumstances surrounding Fletcher's demise, Kennedy and Walter agreed to take on the case.

Upon arriving at the Fletcher estate, they were greeted by a somber atmosphere and a sense of unease among the staff. Mrs. Fletcher, a dignified woman with a steely resolve, led them to the study where her husband had been found dead. Kennedy's keen eyes immediately noted the peculiar details of the room—the overturned chair, the open window, and the faint scent of almonds in the air.

As they examined the scene, Walter discreetly questioned the staff and uncovered a possible motive for murder—a bitter family feud over the inheritance. John G. Fletcher's grandniece, Helen Bond, had been vocal about her dissatisfaction with her uncle's will, which left a considerable portion of his fortune to charity. Rumors abounded that Helen had been pressuring her uncle to change the will in her favor, ensuring her financial security and happiness with her fiancé, Professor Fletcher.

Kennedy and Walter set out to interview Helen, a striking woman with a sharp wit and a calculating demeanor. She welcomed them into her elegant home, but her eyes betrayed a sense of unease as they questioned her about her relationship with her late uncle and her knowledge of the will. Despite her composed facade, Kennedy sensed a desperation in her that hinted at darker secrets lurking beneath the surface.

As they delved deeper into the case, Kennedy and Walter uncovered a complex web of deceit and hidden motives.
