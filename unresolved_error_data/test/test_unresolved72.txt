Professor Kennedy, his assistant Walter, and Secret Service agent Burke had just narrowly escaped a deadly encounter with an anarchist group that had been planning to unleash chaos and destruction. As they caught their breath and assessed the situation, they knew they had to act quickly to prevent the group from carrying out their heinous plot.

It was during this tumultuous time that a young woman named Paula Lowe sought their help. She had unwittingly become entangled in the group's plans and had discovered that Baron Krieger, a prominent figure targeted by the anarchists, was in grave danger. Paula's plea for assistance sparked a sense of urgency in the group, and they immediately set out to protect the Baron and unravel the anarchists' sinister intentions.
