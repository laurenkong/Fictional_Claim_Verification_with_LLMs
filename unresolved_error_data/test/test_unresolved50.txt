The wind howled through the trees surrounding Studley Grange, the ancient estate belonging to the prestigious Studley family. Lady Studley, a woman of elegance and refinement, paced anxiously in the dimly lit drawing room. Her husband, Sir Henry, was upstairs in his bedchamber, suffering from a mysterious illness that had plagued him for weeks. Lady Studley had summoned Dr. Halifax, the renowned physician known for his expertise in diagnosing rare and perplexing ailments.

As Dr. Halifax arrived at the Grange, Lady Studley greeted him with a somber expression. "Thank you for coming, Doctor," she said, leading him up the grand staircase to Sir Henry's room.

Sir Henry lay in bed, his face pale and drawn, his eyes filled with fear. He recounted to Dr. Halifax the terrifying hallucination that had haunted himâ€”a spectral apparition with a large, menacing eye that seemed to follow him wherever he went.

Dr. Halifax listened attentively, his brow furrowed in concentration. After examining Sir Henry and reviewing his symptoms, he requested to be shown the exact location where the apparition had appeared.

Lady Studley led him to a massive oak wardrobe in the corner of the room. As she opened the doors, Dr. Halifax noticed a small, inconspicuous panel hidden among the elaborate carvings. With a swift motion, Lady Studley revealed a secret door concealed within the wardrobe.

"This is where it happened," Lady Studley whispered, her eyes filled with concern.

Dr. Halifax inspected the hidden compartment, his keen eyes scanning every detail. Suddenly, he spotted a large mirror strategically positioned inside the compartment, facing the bed where Sir Henry lay. Next to the mirror was an electric lamp, casting shadows and creating illusions in the dimly lit room.

With a sense of revelation, Dr. Halifax picked up a magnifying glass from the nearby dressing table and examined the mirror closely. He noticed the intricate patterns of light and shadow created by the lamp's reflection, forming the eerie image that had tormented Sir Henry.
