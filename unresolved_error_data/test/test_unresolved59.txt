Charles Duer Carroll strode confidently into the elegant boardroom of the Carroll-Swayne-McPartland Company. As the young and ambitious president of the brokerage concern, he exuded an air of success and charisma that captivated those around him. His sharp mind and quick wit had propelled the company to new heights, despite the financial struggles they had faced in the past.

However, beneath Carroll's charming exterior lay a shrewd businessman with a talent for manipulating the stock market to his advantage. Using the company's securities, he had managed to amass a fortune through clever investments and strategic maneuvers. His success had garnered him both admiration and envy within the financial world.

But Carroll's carefully constructed facade was about to be threatened by an unexpected accusation from his loyal secretary, Gordon Swayne. Swayne, a trusted confidant and longtime employee of the company, had uncovered evidence suggesting that Carroll had been involved in the theft of United States gold bonds.

As Swayne confronted Carroll with the damning information, the young president remained outwardly composed, his mind already racing to devise a plan to protect his reputation and his interests. With the board of directors convened for an emergency meeting, Carroll knew he had to act swiftly to avert a scandal that could tarnish his hard-earned success.

In a bold move, Carroll deftly manipulated the situation, skillfully diverting Swayne's attention and the suspicions of the board members while he set his intricate plan into motion. Unbeknownst to them, Carroll had called upon the brilliant mind of Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, renowned for his unparalleled deductive reasoning and keen analytical skills.

With the assistance of The Thinking Machine, Carroll orchestrated a series of calculated moves and cleverly orchestrated distractions to keep his accusers at bay while he worked behind the scenes to uncover the truth. As the pieces of the puzzle began to fall into place, it became clear that Carroll had indeed been using the company's securities for personal gain.
