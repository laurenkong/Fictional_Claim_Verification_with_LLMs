Inspector Truscott's office was a hive of activity as he and Martin Hewitt poured over the details of the murder of Abel Pullin. Hewitt's keen observations and deductive skills had already led them to suspect Herbert Roofe, the owner of the lost ship Egret, as the likely culprit. The motive seemed to revolve around a cheque for Â£2000 drawn by Pullin on Roofe, possibly as payment for his part in the intentional wreck of the ship.

As they delved deeper into the investigation, more pieces of the puzzle fell into place. Roofe's financial troubles and desperation to keep his business afloat painted a clear picture of a man willing to resort to drastic measures to protect his interests. The evidence was mounting against him, and it was only a matter of time before they would be able to bring him to justice.

Their pursuit led them to Scarby Lodge, Roofe's residence. As they approached the house, a sense of anticipation hung in the air. Truscott and Hewitt exchanged a knowing glance, both aware that they were on the brink of solving a complex and intriguing case.

Upon reaching Scarby Lodge, they devised a plan to confront Roofe and bring him to justice. Hewitt sent in a message requesting a meeting with Roofe on urgent business, while Truscott positioned himself strategically to ensure a smooth arrest.
