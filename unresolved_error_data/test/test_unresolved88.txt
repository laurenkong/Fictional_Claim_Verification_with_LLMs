The sun was setting as Kennedy and his team arrived at the aviation meet. The atmosphere was electric with excitement as pilots prepared for the next day's air races. Norton, the renowned aviator, greeted Kennedy with a smile, eager to show off his skills in the upcoming competition.

As the day of the races dawned, Kennedy couldn't shake a feeling of unease. Two accidents had already occurred during practice runs, and he suspected foul play. Working closely with Norton, Kennedy began investigating the incidents, examining the wreckage of the planes for any signs of sabotage.
