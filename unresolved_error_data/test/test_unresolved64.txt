Thorpe Hazell sat at his favorite table in the corner of the dimly lit restaurant, meticulously dissecting a boiled egg with a small silver knife. His eccentric dining habits, along with his keen observation skills, had earned him a reputation as a detective like no other. As he delicately peeled the egg, a distressed young lady approached his table.

"Mr. Hazell, I am in dire need of your assistance," the young lady, Miss St. John Mallaby, said with a quiver in her voice.

Hazell looked up from his egg, his piercing blue eyes meeting hers. "Please, have a seat and tell me what troubles you, Miss Mallaby."

The young lady took a seat across from him and began to explain her predicament. She had been traveling on a train from London to Edinburgh when she realized that her aunt's precious diamond necklace, a family heirloom, was missing. She suspected that it had been stolen during the journey and had a strong suspicion that the culprit was a fellow passenger, the Honourable George Kestron.

Hazell listened intently, his mind already racing with possibilities. He assured Miss Mallaby that he would do everything in his power to recover the stolen necklace and bring the thief to justice. With a nod of gratitude, Miss Mallaby left Hazell to his meal, knowing that she had entrusted her case to the best possible detective.

After finishing his egg, Hazell paid the bill and made his way to the train station. He boarded the same train that Miss Mallaby had traveled on, retracing her steps and meticulously analyzing every detail of the journey. He spoke to other passengers, observed their behaviors, and pieced together a timeline of events leading up to the disappearance of the necklace.

As the train rattled on towards Edinburgh, Hazell's suspicions began to solidify around the Honourable George Kestron. The man's nervous glances and fidgety demeanor did not escape Hazell's watchful eye. However, he knew he needed concrete evidence to confront Kestron.

With a twinkle in his eye and a plan forming in his mind, Hazell made his way to the first-class carriage where Kestron and his valet, Jameson, were seated. He engaged Kestron in conversation, subtly probing for information while carefully observing his reactions. As the train approached its final destination, Hazell made his move.

In a bold and calculated bluff, Hazell accused Kestron of being involved in the theft of the diamond necklace. The Honourable George Kestron's face paled, but he vehemently denied any wrongdoing. It was then that Hazell turned his attention to Jameson, Kestron's valet, who had been standing quietly in the corner of the carriage.
