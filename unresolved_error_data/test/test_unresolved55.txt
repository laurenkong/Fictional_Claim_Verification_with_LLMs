Mr. Beck, a skilled detective with a sharp eye for detail and a keen sense of intuition, was summoned to the offices of Lloyds by Mr. Livingston, the head of security. The prestigious shipping company had been plagued by a series of mysterious incidents involving dynamite on Joshua Marable's fleet of ships, and they needed Mr. Beck's expertise to get to the bottom of the dangerous sabotage.

As Mr. Beck listened to Mr. Livingston's account of the troubling events, he knew he had to act swiftly to prevent further harm to innocent lives. Determined and resolute, he agreed to take on the case and set out to unravel the mystery behind the explosive attacks.

Intrigued by the challenge that lay ahead, Mr. Beck delved into the background of Joshua Marable, a wealthy and influential shipping magnate with a fleet of vessels that traversed the seas with valuable cargo. Suspicions began to form in Mr. Beck's mind as he learned more about Marable's business dealings and personal life.

To gather more information, Mr. Beck decided to join a voyage to Hong Kong on Marable's flagship vessel, The Queen. Disguised as a passenger, he kept a close watch on Marable and the crew, searching for any clues that could lead him to the culprit behind the sabotage.

During the voyage, Mr. Beck noticed something peculiar about Marable—he always carried two identical black bags wherever he went. One bag seemed to be for show, while the other remained securely by his side at all times. Intrigued by this suspicious behavior, Mr. Beck made it his mission to uncover the contents of the mysterious black bag that Marable kept close to him.

As the journey progressed, tension mounted on board The Queen as Mr. Beck's presence seemed to unsettle Marable. The detective's careful observations and quick thinking led him to uncover a deadly device hidden inside the second black bag—a bomb set to detonate and cause catastrophic destruction.
