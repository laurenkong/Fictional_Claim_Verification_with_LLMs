The wind howled through the barren fields surrounding Scotter's Farm, adding an eerie soundtrack to the desolate landscape. The old farmhouse stood as a dark silhouette against the stormy sky, its windows boarded up and its doors creaking in the gusts of wind. Many in the nearby town of Berwick whispered about the mysterious disappearance of its new resident, David Robb, a retired businessman with a tarnished reputation.

Samuel Behrens, the brother of Robb's missing former business partner, had arrived in Berwick determined to uncover the truth behind his brother's vanishing. Rumors of financial scandals and shady dealings had plagued Robb and his partner before the partner's sudden disappearance, leaving Behrens with a gnawing sense of unease.

As Behrens approached Scotter's Farm, he was struck by the ominous aura that surrounded the place. Knocking on the weather-worn door, he was met with the haggard figure of David Robb, his eyes sunken and his once-impeccable suit now tattered and stained.

"Behrens, what brings you to this forsaken place?" Robb's voice was strained, his demeanor erratic.

"I have come to seek answers, Robb. My brother vanished without a trace after his partnership with you," Behrens replied, his tone firm.

A flicker of madness crossed Robb's face before he composed himself, inviting Behrens inside. The interior of Scotter's Farm was in disarray, with papers strewn about and the faint smell of decay lingering in the air.

As Behrens pressed Robb for information, the retired businessman's demeanor grew increasingly agitated. With a sudden outburst of violence, Robb lunged at Behrens, a glint of madness in his eyes as he attempted to strangle him.

A brutal struggle ensued, with Behrens managing to fend off Robb's attacks and escape with his life, though not unscathed. Bleeding and shaken, Behrens stumbled out into the storm, vowing to return with authorities to uncover the truth hidden within Scotter's Farm.
