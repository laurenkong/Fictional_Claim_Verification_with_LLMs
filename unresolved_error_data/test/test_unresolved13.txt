It was a brisk autumn day when J. Morgan Grayson, a prominent financier known for his astute business acumen, found himself facing a dilemma that threatened to unravel his entire empire. Sitting in his opulent office, with its mahogany desk and walls adorned with framed stock certificates, Grayson fumed as he recounted the recent string of financial losses that had plagued his firm.

Summoning all his resolve, Grayson picked up the telephone and dialed a number he had never thought he would need to call—the office of Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, the enigmatic genius known far and wide as The Thinking Machine.

Within hours, the professor arrived at Grayson's office, his keen blue eyes taking in every detail with razor-sharp focus. Grayson wasted no time in outlining the problem that had brought him to seek the help of the brilliant scientist.

"I am losing millions, Professor Van Dusen," Grayson began, his tone grave. "Confidential information about my business dealings, my investments, everything—it's all being leaked. I suspect my stenographer, Miss Evelyn Winthrop, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how she's doing it."

The Thinking Machine listened intently, his mind already whirring with possibilities. He requested to speak with Miss Winthrop and observe her at work. Grayson readily agreed, eager to uncover the source of the leak that threatened his financial empire.

As The Thinking Machine observed Miss Winthrop transcribing dictation, his sharp eyes caught the subtle movements of her fingers on the typewriter keys. He noticed the precise rhythm with which she typed, the slight pauses between certain letters, and the way she glanced at the telephone on her desk every so often.

After a thorough examination, The Thinking Machine requested access to Grayson's telegraph office, where Miss Winthrop also worked part-time as a telegraph operator. As he watched her deftly handle the telegraph key, a realization dawned on the professor.
