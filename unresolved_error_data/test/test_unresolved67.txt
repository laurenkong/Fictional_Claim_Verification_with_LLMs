The rain poured down in sheets as Mr Carlyle hurried through the bustling streets of London, determined to find this mysterious expert Mr Baxter had mentioned – Wynn Carrados. The private detective’s mind raced with skepticism. How could a blind man help him solve the case of the ancient coin forgery? It seemed preposterous, but he was willing to entertain the idea, if only out of sheer curiosity.

Arriving at the address Baxter had provided, Carlyle found himself standing before a modest yet elegant house in Richmond. Taking a deep breath, he rang the doorbell and was ushered inside by a courteous servant.

Moments later, Carlyle found himself facing Wynn Carrados, a man of calm demeanor, seated in a study. The private detective couldn’t help but feel a twinge of doubt as he observed the blind man before him. How could he possibly assist in unraveling the complexities of the forgery scheme?

Mr Carrados, however, seemed unperturbed by Carlyle’s skepticism. With a faint smile, he welcomed his guest and listened as Mr Carlyle recounted the reason for his visit – the mysterious ancient coin that may be a forgery.

Challenged by Carlyle to prove his abilities, Carrados accepted the test with quiet confidence. He began to describe the private detective in intricate detail, from the slight crease in his left trouser leg to the faint scent of sandalwood that lingered around him. Mr Carlyle watched in astonishment as Carrados painted a vivid portrait of him without the aid of sight.

Impressed and slightly unnerved, Mr Carlyle could no longer deny the extraordinary observational skills possessed by Wynn Carrados. He listened intently as Carrados unveiled the intricate web of deceit surrounding the forgery scheme, involving the cunning forger Pietro Stelli and his accomplice posing as a maid.
