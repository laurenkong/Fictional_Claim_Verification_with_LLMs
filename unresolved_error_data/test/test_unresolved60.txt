The storm raged outside, the wind howling and rain lashing against the windows of the old, secluded house where the tense drama was about to unfold. Max Carrados, the renowned detective, stood in the darkened hallway, his keen senses alert and his mind sharp as he awaited the arrival of Mr. Creake, the man suspected of planning harm against his wife, Millicent.

As the clock struck midnight, Lieutenant Hollyer, Millicent's brother and a key player in the plan, took his position in the spare room, disguised as his sister. With careful attention to detail, he imitated her movements and habits, ready to lure Creake into revealing his true intentions.

Meanwhile, Carrados and his team strategically placed themselves in various hiding spots throughout the house, their eyes trained on every corner, ready to pounce at a moment's notice. The tension in the air was palpable, each member of the team fully aware of the danger that lurked in the shadows.

Outside, the sound of the approaching tram could be heard, its electric wires crackling with power. This was the moment they had been waiting for â€“ the moment when Creake would make his move to harm Millicent using the deadly electricity from the tram wire.
