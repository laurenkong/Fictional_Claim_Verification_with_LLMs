Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, known as "The Thinking Machine," sat in his cluttered laboratory, surrounded by books, scientific instruments, and stacks of papers. His keen mind was always at work, solving the most complex of puzzles and unraveling the most baffling mysteries. As he sat at his desk, engrossed in a particularly challenging problem, there came a knock on the door.

"Come in," the professor called, without looking up from his work.

The door opened, and in walked Admiral Hausen-Aubier and Baron Von Hartzfeldt, two distinguished gentlemen with grave expressions on their faces.

"Professor Van Dusen, we come to you in a time of great need," began the Admiral.

The professor finally looked up, his sharp eyes assessing the two men before him. "Please, have a seat. What seems to be the problem?"

The Admiral and the Baron proceeded to explain the situation. Crown Prince Otto Ludwig of Germania-Austria had been mysteriously abducted from the battleship Friedrich der Grosse while on a diplomatic mission. Despite extensive investigations and searches, the prince's whereabouts remained unknown. The Admiral and the Baron had come to seek the renowned detective's assistance in solving the case.

The Thinking Machine listened intently, his mind already whirling with possibilities. After a few moments of silence, he spoke.
