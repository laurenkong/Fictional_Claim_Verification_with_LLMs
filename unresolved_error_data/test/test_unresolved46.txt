Dr. Stewart, a close friend of Miss Myrl, arrived at her elegant Victorian home on a crisp autumn afternoon. As he settled into a plush armchair in the parlor, Miss Myrl poured them both a cup of fragrant Earl Grey tea.

"Ah, Miss Myrl, I have a most perplexing tale to share with you today," began Dr. Stewart, his eyes alight with intrigue.

Miss Myrl, a woman of sharp wit and keen intellect, leaned forward attentively. "Pray, do tell, Doctor. I am all ears."

Dr. Stewart proceeded to recount the curious case of Major-General Sir Anthony Collingswood's missing diamond, a priceless gem gifted to him by the Rajah of Ringanpore. The diamond had been in the Collingswood family for generations, a symbol of honor and prestige. However, during the sale of the diamond at a reputable jewelry merchant's office, it was discovered that the precious gem had been switched with a smaller, inferior stone.

"Goodness gracious, what a scandal!" exclaimed Miss Myrl, her eyes widening in astonishment. "And what became of Major-General Collingswood's nephew, Alan?"

"Ah, that is where the plot thickens," replied Dr. Stewart. "Young Alan Collingswood was accused of deceiving his uncle by swapping the diamond, despite his vehement protests of innocence. The evidence against him was strong, and his reputation was in tatters."

Miss Myrl furrowed her brow in contemplation. "It seems a dire situation indeed. But fear not, dear Doctor, for where there is a mystery, there is always a solution waiting to be uncovered."

With a mischievous twinkle in her eye, Miss Myrl proposed a daring plan to clear Alan's name once and for all. She arranged for a final meeting at the diamond merchant's office, under the guise of discussing a potential purchase from their exquisite collection.

As they entered the opulent office, Miss Myrl discretely hid a small magnet within the handle of her elegant parasol, a clever tool that would reveal the truth behind the diamond's mysterious disappearance.

The diamond merchant, a distinguished gentleman with a hawk-like gaze, greeted them warmly and presented a selection of dazzling gems for their perusal. As Miss Myrl feigned interest in various pieces, her keen eyes darted towards the fateful diamond that had caused such turmoil.

With a deft flick of her wrist, Miss Myrl subtly brought the magnet close to the diamond, hidden in plain sight amidst the other jewels on display. To her astonishment, the diamond reacted, shifting slightly as if drawn by an unseen force.

A gasp of realization escaped Miss Myrl's lips as she turned to the diamond merchant.
