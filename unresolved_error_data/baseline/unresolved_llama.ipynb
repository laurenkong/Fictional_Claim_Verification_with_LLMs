Fletcher unexpectedly passed away, leaving the will unsigned and the inheritance in limbo. Helen's desperation to secure her future had driven her to desperate measures, but the consequences of her actions had spiraled out of control, leading to tragedy.\\n\\nIn a dramatic confrontation at the Fletcher estate, Kennedy and Walter confronted Helen with the evidence of her manipulation and deceit. Faced with the truth, Helen broke down and confessed to her involvement in the plot to alter the will. She tearfully admitted her fear of losing everything and her misguided attempts to ensure her happiness at any cost.\\n\\nMoved by Helen's vulnerability and regret, Kennedy and Walter orchestrated a plan to protect her from the legal fallout of her actions while ensuring that justice was served. Together, they unraveled the mystery, untangling the threads of deceit and betrayal that had ensnared the Fletcher family.\\n\\nIn the end, relationships were tested, truths were revealed, and lessons were learned about the complexities of human nature and the depths of love and desperation.

Determined and resolute, he agreed to take on the case and set out to unravel the mystery behind the explosive attacks.\\n\\nIntrigued by the challenge that lay ahead, Mr. Beck delved into the background of Joshua Marable, a wealthy and influential shipping magnate with a fleet of vessels that traversed the seas with valuable cargo. Suspicions began to form in Mr. Beck's mind as he learned more about Marable's business dealings and personal life.\\n\\nTo gather more information, Mr. Beck decided to join a voyage to Hong Kong on Marable's flagship vessel, The Queen.

Pretty and beloved Mrs. Vincent, known for her kindness and grace, had been found stabbed to the heart in her own study.\\n\\nThe town was in shock, unable to comprehend such a brutal act in their midst. With no clear motive or suspects in sight, the case fell into the hands of Detective Thomas Reed, a seasoned investigator known for his keen intuition and sharp mind.\\n\\nAs Detective Reed delved into the investigation, he quickly realized that the quiet facade of Brixton hid a world of secrets and lies. Mrs. Vincent's husband, the young and charming Mr. Vincent, appeared grief-stricken and devastated by his wife's tragic death. But as Reed dug deeper, he began to uncover inconsistencies in Mr. Vincent's alibi and behavior.\\n\\nOne clue led to another, and soon Reed stumbled upon a mysterious green-stone idol hidden in the Vincent household. The idol, with its strange carvings and eerie aura, seemed out of place in the elegant home of the Vincents. Reed knew he had stumbled upon a significant piece of the puzzle, but its true significance eluded him for the time being.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a determined woman named Evelyn approached Detective Reed, claiming to have vital information about the case. Evelyn revealed that she was seeking justice for her lover, who had been involved in a romantic entanglement with Mrs. Vincent. She painted a picture of a love triangle gone wrong, of jealousy and betrayal that ultimately led to Mrs. Vincent's untimely demise.\\n\\nAs Reed pieced together the information provided by Evelyn and the evidence he had gathered, a chilling realization dawned on him. Mr. Vincent's carefully constructed alibi began to crumble, revealing a sinister plot to rid himself of his wife and his romantic rival. The green-stone idol, a symbol of greed and deception, played a crucial role in the unfolding drama.\\n\\nIn a stunning turn of events, the real murderer was unmasked, and justice was served. The revelation sent shockwaves through Brixton, as the townspeople grappled with the truth behind Mrs. Vincent's tragic death. Chance had played a significant role in the unraveling of the case, proving that in the game of detective work, sometimes fate had a hand in bringing the guilty to justice.\\n\\nAs the sun set on the once peaceful town of Brixton, Detective Reed reflected on the twists and turns of the investigation.

Story: In the secluded mountains behind Virginia, nestled in the mist-shrouded valleys where the trees whispered ancient secrets and the wind carried a haunting melody, there stood the stone house of Doomdorf. A man of dark repute, Doomdorf was known for his illicit liquor that held a devilish allure to those who dared to taste it. The locals whispered tales of his shady past and the chaos his hellish brew brought upon the community.\n",
            "Uncle Abner, a wise and respected elder of the area, and Squire Randolph, a man of authority and influence, grew concerned about the impacts of Doomdorf's activities on the community. Together, they decided to confront the mysterious man and put an end to his nefarious deeds once and for all.\n",
            "One fateful evening, they made their way to Doomdorf's stone house, determined to face him and demand an end to his brewing. But as they approached, they were met with an eerie silence that seemed to wrap the house in a shroud of foreboding.\n",
            "Upon breaking into Doomdorf's locked room, Uncle Abner and Squire Randolph were met with a sight that chilled them to the bone—Doomdorf lay dead on the floor, a bullet wound in his chest. The room was in disarray, with bottles of his infamous liquor scattered around, casting an ominous glow in the dim light.\n",
            "As they grappled with the shock of Doomdorf's death, a series of confessions began to emerge from unlikely sources within the community. Each person claimed responsibility for the murder in their own bizarre and twisted ways, weaving a web of lies and deceit that only served to deepen the mystery surrounding Doomdorf's demise.\n",
            "Amidst the chaos and confusion, Uncle Abner and Squire Randolph sought to uncover the truth behind Doomdorf's death. Each confession led them down a twisted path of secrets and lies, where the line between reality and illusion blurred in the shadows of the mountains.\n",
            "It was during a moment of quiet contemplation, as they sat in Doomdorf's room surrounded by the echoes of his dark past, that a beam of sunlight pierced through the window, illuminating a water bottle on the floor. The sunlight refracted through the clear liquid, casting a rainbow of colors across the room.\n",
            "In that moment of clarity, Uncle Abner's sharp eyes caught sight of something glinting within the water bottle—a reflection of a loaded gun that had been hidden in plain sight. With a sudden realization, Uncle Abner understood the truth behind Doomdorf's death.\n",

However, the story lacks a deeper exploration of the characters' motivations and emotions, as well as a more satisfying resolution to the conflict.

As an amateur photographer with a keen eye for detail and a lover of rare books, Hazell often found himself drawn to unusual situations that required his unique skills of observation and deduction.\n",

Little did he know that this ordinary day would soon lead him into the heart of a daring railway mystery that would test his investigative prowess like never before.\n",

Intrigued by the unusual circumstances, Hazell decided to delve deeper into the matter, sensing that there was more to the story than met the eye.\n",
            "Through his network of contacts, Hazell learned that the missing truck contained three priceless paintings belonging to Sir Gilbert Murrell, a prominent art collector. The paintings, including a renowned Velasquez masterpiece, were intended to be showcased at the prestigious exhibition in Winchester. However, the sudden disappearance of the truck raised suspicions of foul play.\n",

With Jeffreys' insider knowledge of the criminal underworld and Hazell's sharp deductive skills, they were able to piece together the elaborate scheme orchestrated by an unknown mastermind.\n",

With the evidence now in their hands, Hazell and Jeffreys were able to blackmail Sir Gilbert into confessing to his crimes and paying a hefty fine to avoid prosecution.\n",

His eccentric dining habits, along with his keen observation skills, had earned him a reputation as a detective like no other. As he delicately peeled the egg, a distressed young lady approached his table.\n",

She had been traveling on a train from London to Edinburgh when she realized that her aunt's precious diamond necklace, a family heirloom, was missing.

            "With a twinkle in his eye and a plan forming in his mind, Hazell made his way to the first-class carriage where Kestron and his valet, Jameson, were seated. He engaged Kestron in conversation, subtly probing for information while carefully observing his reactions. As the train approached its final destination, Hazell made his move.\n",

The Honourable George Kestron's face paled, but he vehemently denied any wrongdoing. It was then that Hazell turned his attention to Jameson, Kestron's valet, who had been standing quietly in the corner of the carriage.\n",

However, the story is somewhat lacking in character development, as the characters of Miss Mallaby and the Honourable George Kestron are only briefly introduced and do not have distinct personalities or motivations.

He followed them through the labyrinthine corridors, the darkness pressing in around them like a suffocating cloak.\n",
            "Finally, they reached a dimly lit room, its walls lined with shelves filled with dusty books and strange curiosities. In the center of the room lay a coffin, its lid slightly ajar, and James felt a chill run down his spine.\n",
            "The elderly man gestured for James to sit, and the girl took a seat beside him, her eyes sparkling with a mischievous glint. As they sipped their drinks, James couldn't help but feel that something sinister was lurking beneath the surface, waiting to pounce.\n",

The voice on the other end of the line spoke in hushed tones, urging Valmont to meet at a discreet location to discuss a matter of utmost importance.\n",

Hazard, a skilled manufacturer of imitation diamonds, had devised an elaborate plan to switch the real necklace with a duplicate, all while leading the authorities on a wild goose chase.\n",

He warned Von Bork to exercise caution and vigilance in his actions, knowing that any misstep could lead to disastrous consequences.\n",
            "Unbeknownst to Von Bork, a shadowy figure had been observing their conversation from a distance. Sherlock Holmes, the renowned detective, had assumed the guise of an American agent named Altamont in order to infiltrate Von Bork's circle and gather evidence of his illicit activities. As Von Herling took his leave, Holmes approached Von Bork with a confident stride, revealing his true identity with a sly smile.\n",
            "Von Bork's expression shifted from surprise to realization as he recognized the famous detective standing before him. He knew that his carefully constructed web of deceit was about to unravel. The story is approximately 80% complete in terms of plot development. While the introduction of Sherlock Holmes as a detective infiltrating Von Bork's circle adds a new element to the story, the plot remains unresolved, leaving the reader wondering what will happen next. The story could benefit from further development of the characters and their motivations, as well as a more satisfying resolution to the conflict.\n"

            "Kennedy had been called in by Norton himself, who suspected foul play in the series of unexplained crashes that had cast a shadow over his innovative creations. With the assistance of the Pinkertons, Kennedy had been meticulously investigating the incidents, piecing together clues and following leads that had ultimately led him to a surprising revelation.\n",
            "As the demonstration began, Norton's gyroscope machines whirred to life, lifting the aeroplanes into the sky with precision and grace. The crowd watched in awe as the aircraft soared through the air, performing intricate maneuvers that showcased the capabilities of Norton's invention. However, just as the excitement reached its peak, disaster struck once again.\n",
            "A sudden jolt shook one of the aeroplanes, causing it to spiral out of control and plummet towards the ground. Panic ensued as the crowd gasped in horror, but Kennedy remained calm, his keen eyes scanning the scene for any signs of sabotage. He had a hunch that the accidents were not mere mishaps but deliberate acts of sabotage orchestrated by someone with a sinister agenda.\n",
            "With quick thinking and meticulous attention to detail, Kennedy deployed an ondometer, a device of his own invention that could pinpoint the source of interference in electronic equipment. As he swept the area with the ondometer, a signal led him towards a secluded corner of the park where a figure lurked in the shadows.\n",
            "Kennedy's heart raced as he approached the mysterious figure, his mind racing with possibilities. As he drew closer, the figure turned to face him, revealing a familiar face - none other than Norton's business rival, Mortimer. The plot thickened as Kennedy realized that Mortimer had been manipulating the accidents to discredit Norton and gain an advantage in the market.\n",
            "With the truth now revealed, Kennedy and the Pinkertons moved in to apprehend Mortimer and put an end to his nefarious schemes. As the dust settled, Kennedy couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment at having solved the mystery and brought the culprit to justice.\n",
            "The story is approximately 75% complete in terms of plot development. While the main conflict and twist have been revealed, there are still some loose ends that need to be tied up, such as the exact nature of Mortimer's schemes and the extent of his involvement in the accidents. Additionally, the story could benefit from a more detailed resolution to the mystery and a clearer sense of Kennedy's emotional journey throughout the events.\n"

Story: It was a crisp autumn morning when Martin Hewitt received a peculiar request from a local constable to assist in a case involving illicit distilling. The small town of Oakwood had been abuzz with rumors of a secret operation producing illegal spirits, and the constabulary had finally managed to uncover the location of the distilling ring. Hewitt, intrigued by the challenge, set out to investigate the matter further.\n",
            "Upon arrival at the site of the distillery, Hewitt's sharp eyes immediately noted the subtle signs of clandestine activity. The nursery, located at the outskirts of town, appeared innocent enough on the surface, but Hewitt sensed there was more to it than met the eye. With his trusty assistant by his side, they began a thorough examination of the nursery, carefully inspecting each corner and crevice for any clues that might lead them to the heart of the operation.\n",
            "After hours of meticulous searching, Hewitt's assistant stumbled upon a hidden trapdoor beneath a rug in the greenhouse. Without hesitation, they opened the trapdoor and descended into a dark, damp cellar below. What they found was beyond their wildest expectations—a fully functioning distillery, complete with copper stills, barrels of fermenting mash, and shelves lined with bottles of illicit spirits.\n",
            "As they explored the cellar, Hewitt's keen observations revealed the intricacies of the operation. It became clear that Samuel Geldard, a wealthy but unassuming nursery owner, was the mastermind behind the distilling ring. Geldard had been producing the spirits under the guise of a nursery, cleverly disguising the distillery as a legitimate business.\n",
            "The investigation was far from over, however. Hewitt and his assistant had yet to uncover the full extent of Geldard's operation and the true purpose behind the illicit distilling. With their discovery of the hidden cellar, they had only just scratched the surface of the intricate web of secrets that surrounded the town of Oakwood.\n",

But as Reed dug deeper, he began to uncover inconsistencies in Mr. Vincent's alibi and behavior.\\nOne clue led to another, and soon Reed stumbled upon a mysterious green-stone idol hidden in the Vincent household. The idol, with its strange carvings and eerie aura, seemed out of place in the elegant home of the Vincents. Reed knew he had stumbled upon a significant piece of the puzzle, but its true significance eluded him for the time being.\\nMeanwhile, a determined woman named Evelyn approached Detective Reed, claiming to have vital information about the case. Evelyn revealed that she was seeking justice for her lover, who had been involved in a romantic entanglement with Mrs. Vincent. She painted a picture of a love triangle gone wrong, of jealousy and betrayal that ultimately led to Mrs. Vincent's untimely demise.\\nAs Reed pieced together the information provided by Evelyn and the evidence he had gathered, a chilling realization dawned on him. Mr. Vincent's carefully constructed alibi began to crumble, revealing a sinister plot to rid himself of his wife and his romantic rival. The green-stone idol, a symbol of greed and deception, played a crucial role in the unfolding drama.\\nIn a stunning turn of events, the real murderer was unmasked, and justice was served. The revelation sent shockwaves through Brixton, as the townspeople grappled with the truth behind Mrs. Vincent's tragic death. Chance had played a significant role in the unraveling of the case, proving that in the game of detective work, sometimes fate had a hand in bringing the guilty to justice.\\nAs the sun set on the once peaceful town of Brixton, Detective Reed reflected on the twists and turns of the investigation. The case of Mrs. Vincent's murder had been solved, but the scars left behind would linger for a long time to come. And in the quiet streets of Brixton, the shadows of deceit and betrayal served as a stark reminder that darkness could lurk behind even the most beautiful facades.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reveal_sentence\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 101,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Through a combination of clever deductions and scientific analyses, they pieced together the events leading up to John G.

However, there are some areas where the story could be further developed, such as the characters' backstories and the exact nature of the blackmailer's secret. Additionally, the ending feels a bit rushed, and there is a lack of resolution regarding the missing will and the blackmailer's identity.

The locals whispered tales of his shady past and the chaos his hellish brew brought upon the community.\n",

            "Detective Mallory and Dr. Clough were called to the scene, but the case proved to be a puzzling one. The dead man was identified as Langham Dudley, a wealthy ship owner with no known enemies or criminal ties. The cause of death was determined to be a Japanese poison, adding another layer of mystery to the already perplexing case.\n",
            "In their frustration, Detective Mallory and Dr. Clough reached out to The Thinking Machine, a renowned scientist and problem-solver known for his brilliant deductive reasoning skills. The Thinking Machine arrived at the scene, his sharp eyes scanning the area for clues and evidence.\n",
            "Through a series of meticulous observations and deductions, The Thinking Machine soon uncovered a web of deceit and betrayal surrounding Langham Dudley. The dead man had been murdered by a member of his own crew, who had been bribed by a rival ship owner to eliminate Dudley and gain control of his fleet.\n",

But the case was not yet closed, as The Thinking Machine continued to unravel the complex web of motives and alibis that had surrounded the crime.\n",

While the initial mystery has been introduced and the main characters have been introduced, there are still several key plot points that need to be resolved before the story can be considered complete. These include the identity of the killer, the motive behind the murder, and the full extent of the criminal's scheme. Without these details, the story feels unfinished and lacks a sense of closure.

            "It all began when Hazell overheard a conversation at the local railway station about a missing goods truck that was supposed to be carrying valuable paintings from Leamington to Winchester for an upcoming exhibition. Intrigued by the unusual circumstances, Hazell decided to delve deeper into the matter, sensing that there was more to the story than met the eye.\n",
            "Through his network of contacts, Hazell learned that the missing truck contained three priceless paintings belonging to Sir Gilbert Murrell, a prominent art collector. The paintings, including a renowned Velasquez masterpiece, were intended to be showcased at the prestigious exhibition in Winchester. However, the sudden disappearance of the truck raised suspicions of foul play.\n",
            "Hazell's intuition led him to a shady character named Jeffreys, a known criminal with a penchant for daring heists. Sensing an opportunity to uncover the truth behind the missing paintings, Hazell approached Jeffreys with a proposition to work together in unraveling the mystery.\n",
            "Under the guise of a partnership, Hazell and Jeffreys delved into the intricate details of the daring plan to steal the original painting and replace it with a clever forgery. With Jeffreys' insider knowledge of the criminal underworld and Hazell's sharp deductive skills, they were able to piece together the elaborate scheme orchestrated by an unknown mastermind.\n",
            "As they worked tirelessly to uncover the truth, Hazell and Jeffreys followed a trail of clues that eventually led them to an old sheep well on the outskirts of a remote village. There, they discovered a hidden chamber containing the stolen paintings, along with a cryptic message from the mastermind.\n",
            "With the mystery solved and the paintings recovered, Hazell and Jeffreys were hailed as heroes in the small town of Leamington. Their collaboration had not only brought the thief to justice but had also revealed a hidden layer of complexity in the seemingly ordinary events that had unfolded.\n",
            "In terms of plot development, the story is approximately 70% complete. While the main mystery has been resolved, there are still several unanswered questions and plot threads that could be explored further. For instance, the identity of the mastermind behind the theft remains a mystery, and the motives behind the daring heist could be delved into in greater detail. Additionally, the interactions between Hazell and Jeffreys could be further developed, exploring their dynamic and how their partnership evolves throughout the investigation.\n"

The solicitor's voice trembled over the phone as he explained the dire situation he found himself in. A woman had been brutally murdered in a railway carriage, and all evidence pointed towards him as the prime suspect.\n",
            "Without hesitation, Thorndyke enlisted the help of his colleague, Jervis, and together they set out to defend Mr. Stopford. As they delved into the details of the case, it became clear that the odds were stacked against them. The police were convinced of Mr. Stopford's guilt, and the public outcry for justice was deafening.\n",
            "Undeterred, Thorndyke and Jervis began their investigation. They visited the crime scene, meticulously examining every inch of the railway carriage where the murder had taken place. Thorndyke's keen eye picked up on subtle details that others had overlooked, and slowly but surely, a different picture began to emerge.\n",

For example, the story does not provide any information about the victim's background, the motive behind the murder, or the identity of the killer. Additionally, the story does not convey the emotional toll that the investigation took on Thorndyke and Jervis, which could have added depth to the narrative.

Story: Belmore Park was abuzz with excitement as aviator Charles Norton prepared for his groundbreaking flight in his gyroscope-equipped machine. The park was packed with spectators eager to witness the historic event. Among the crowd was Kennedy, a seasoned investigator known for his keen eye and sharp intuition.\n",
            "Kennedy had been called in to look into a series of mysterious aeroplane accidents that had been plaguing Belmore Park. There seemed to be no logical explanation for the crashes, and Kennedy suspected foul play. As Norton made his final preparations, Kennedy couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.\n",
            "As Norton took to the skies in his gyroscopic aircraft, Kennedy began his investigation. He started by interviewing witnesses and examining the wreckage of the previous accidents. There were no signs of mechanical failure or pilot error, leading Kennedy to believe that someone was intentionally causing the crashes.\n",
            "Through his inquiries, Kennedy learned of a man named Lamar who had been seen lurking around the park in the days leading up to the accidents. Lamar had introduced himself as Dr. K. Lamar, a scientist interested in studying aeroplane technology. However, Kennedy's instincts told him that Lamar's intentions were far from scientific.\n",
            "As Norton's flight approached its climax, Kennedy's suspicions grew stronger. He had reason to believe that Lamar was involved in the sabotage, but he needed concrete evidence to prove it. Just as Norton was about to land, Kennedy received a call from an anonymous source revealing Lamar's true identity and his involvement in the accidents.\n",
            "Norton touched down safely, but Kennedy's investigation was far from over. He immediately went to the park to confront Lamar, who was caught red-handed and confessed to his crimes. The mystery of the aeroplane accidents was solved, and justice was served.\n",
            "Estimation of plot development proportion: 7/10\n",
            "This story has several key elements of plot development, including:\n",
            "1. Inciting Incident: The story begins with the inciting incident of Norton's groundbreaking flight, which sets the stage for the subsequent events.\n",
            "2. Rising Action: The story builds towards the climax of Kennedy's investigation, which uncovers the truth behind the mysterious accidents.\n",
            "3. Climax: The climax is reached when Kennedy confronts Lamar and exposes his involvement in the sabotage.\n",
            "4. Falling Action: The story concludes with the aftermath of Lamar's confession and the resolution of the mystery.\n",
            "5. Denouement: The story ends with Kennedy's satisfaction at having solved the case and the park's relief at the safety of Norton and the other aviators.\n",
            "However, there are still some gaps in the plot development. For instance:\n",
            "1. Motivation: While Kennedy's instincts suggest that Lamar's intentions are far from scientific, the story doesn't provide a clear motivation for Lamar's actions.\n",
            "2. Obstacles: The story doesn't present any significant obstacles for Kennedy's investigation, which makes the investigation feel a bit too straightforward.\n",
            "3. Character Development: While Kennedy is established as a seasoned investigator with sharp intuition, the story could benefit from more character development and backstory for the supporting characters.\n",
            "Overall, the plot development in this story is around 70% complete. With some additional elements, such as more character development and obstacles for Kennedy's investigation, the story could be more fully developed.\n"

Lola was the owner of a peculiar artifact—an intricately carved turquoise skull—that seemed to hold a sinister power over those who encountered it. Little did we know that this skull would become the centerpiece of a twisted and deadly game orchestrated by Lola herself.\n",

It was on a stormy night, with lightning illuminating the sky in eerie flashes, that tragedy struck. Harry, drawn by an irresistible force, touched the skull, triggering its deadly mechanisms.

Delving into the dark history of the artifact, I unraveled a web of deceit and revenge woven by a vengeful recluse named Felix.

Her prized collection of Charrington jewels, passed down through generations, had gone missing, and she suspected foul play.\n",
            "As Dorcas read through the details provided by Mrs. Charrington, a picture began to form in her mind. The prime suspect appeared to be Claude Charrington, Mrs. Charrington's stepson from her late husband's previous marriage.

            "As the days passed, a series of high-profile thefts began to plague the store, leaving both employees and shoppers on edge. Valuable items seemed to vanish without a trace, and despite Michael's best efforts, the culprit remained elusive. Frustrated and at a loss, Michael knew he needed help beyond his usual detective skills.\n",

Using cutting-edge forensic tools such as a motion camera and a psychometer, he began to piece together the puzzle of the thefts. With meticulous attention to detail, Kennedy analyzed the patterns of the crimes and delved deep into the psychology of the perpetrator.\n",
            "As his investigation progressed, Kennedy uncovered a startling connection between the sophisticated shoplifter Annie Grayson and Mrs. Willoughby, a well-to-do patron of the store known for her penchant for shoplifting due to her kleptomania. It became clear to Kennedy that Annie had been manipulating Mrs. Willoughby into stealing valuable items for her own gain.\n",
            "With this crucial piece of information in hand, Kennedy and Michael worked together to apprehend the culprits and restore peace to Trimble's department store. The case was solved, and justice was served.\n",

Story: Eugène Valmont, a distinguished private detective with a reputation for solving the most perplexing cases, sat in his office sipping his morning coffee. As he perused the latest issue of Le Matin, his secretary informed him of a potential client waiting in the reception area. Valmont raised an eyebrow in mild curiosity, wondering what sort of case awaited him.\n",
            "The client turned out to be Bentham Gibbes, a pickle manufacturer with a look of distress on his face. Gibbes launched into his tale of woe, detailing how a packet of money had gone missing from his dinner party the night before. Valmont listened with polite disinterest, not one to be easily swayed by tales of petty theft.\n",
            "As Gibbes continued, he mentioned a peculiar clue that caught Valmont's attention—the mention of silver spoons. Intrigued by the seemingly innocuous detail, Valmont's interest was piqued. He agreed to take on the case, more out of curiosity than anything else.\n",
            "Valmont decided to start his investigation by interviewing the guests who had attended Gibbes' dinner party. Among them was Vincent Innis, a charming but enigmatic man with a penchant for collecting curiosities. Valmont observed Innis closely, noting his subtle gestures and expressions as they conversed.\n",
            "With the guidance of another guest, Lionel Dacre, Valmont began to piece together the puzzle. Dacre, a keen observer himself, pointed out several instances where Innis had exhibited suspicious behavior during the dinner party. Valmont's deductive skills went to work, connecting the dots and unraveling the mystery bit by bit.\n",
            "As the investigation unfolded, Valmont discovered that Innis had been using the stolen money to fund his latest obsession—a collection of rare and exotic butterflies. The case was solved, and Valmont's reputation as a detective was solidified.\n",
            "Based on the information provided, I would estimate that the plot development in this story is around 30% complete. While we have a clear main character and plot point (the missing money), the story is still in its early stages, with many details yet to be revealed. The investigation has just begun, and we have yet to see how Valmont will unravel the mystery.\n"

Story: In the rolling hills of Virginia, the circuit court had convened on a day heavy with foreboding. The old courthouse stood as a silent witness to the dramas that would unfold within its walls. As the first rays of sunlight filtered through the trees, two men made their way up the stone steps, their entrance into the courthouse marking the beginning of a tale that would grip the entire county.\n",
            "The first man, Randolph, was a figure of pomp and ostentation. His clothes were immaculate, his posture erect, and his demeanor exuded an air of superiority. In stark contrast, Abner was a man of few words, his imposing frame and weathered appearance hinting at a depth of experience and wisdom that belied his simple attire.\n",
            "As they entered the courthouse, their contrasting personas seemed to set the stage for the unfolding drama. It was not long before they encountered the enigmatic figure of Northcote Moore, a man whose very presence seemed to cast a shadow over the proceedings. With his piercing gaze and air of mystery, Northcote Moore exuded an aura of intrigue that set the men on edge.\n",
            "As the court proceedings began, Abner found himself drawn into a web of deception and intrigue surrounding a mysterious murder at Eastwood Court. The evidence was murky, the motives unclear, but as Abner delved deeper into the case, suspicions began to fall on Northcote Moore and his nephew, Esdale Moore.\n",
            "The courtroom buzzed with whispered conversations and furtive glances as Abner presented his findings to the judge and jury. His intricate deductions and shocking revelations laid bare the dark underbelly of human nature, exposing the greed, jealousy, and deceit that lurked beneath the surface of polite society.\n",
            "As the trial reached its climax, tensions rose to a fever pitch. Accusations flew, tempers flared, and the truth finally emerged in a blaze of revelation. The courtroom fell silent as Abner stood before the gathered crowd, his words ringing out with a clarity that cut through the confusion and lies.\n",
            "In the end, justice was served, but not before the full extent of the deception was revealed. The men left the courthouse, their lives forever changed by the events that had transpired within those walls. And as they walked away, the old courthouse stood as a testament to the enduring power of truth and the indomitable spirit of those who sought it.\n",
            "Based on the provided excerpt, I would estimate that the story is approximately 70% complete in terms of plot development. While the excerpt provides a good introduction to the characters and setting, it only gives a glimpse into the central conflict and the events that unfold in the courthouse. There are still many questions left unanswered, such as the identity of the murder victim, the motives of Northcote Moore, and the ultimate resolution of the trial. Therefore, there is still significant room for plot development and expansion.\n"

Lady Studley, a woman of elegance and refinement, paced anxiously in the dimly lit drawing room. Her husband, Sir Henry, was upstairs in his bedchamber, suffering from a mysterious illness that had plagued him for weeks. Lady Studley had summoned Dr. Halifax, the renowned physician known for his expertise in diagnosing rare and perplexing ailments.\n",

            "Dr. Halifax listened attentively, his brow furrowed in concentration. After examining Sir Henry and reviewing his symptoms, he requested to be shown the exact location where the apparition had appeared.\n",
            "Lady Studley led him to a massive oak wardrobe in the corner of the room. As she opened the doors, Dr. Halifax noticed a small, inconspicuous panel hidden among the elaborate carvings. With a swift motion, Lady Studley revealed a secret door concealed within the wardrobe.\n",

Suddenly, he spotted a large mirror strategically positioned inside the compartment, facing the bed where Sir Henry lay. Next to the mirror was an electric lamp, casting shadows and creating illusions in the dimly lit room.\n",
            "With a sense of revelation, Dr. Halifax picked up a magnifying glass from the nearby dressing table and examined the mirror closely. He noticed the intricate patterns of light and shadow created by the lamp's reflection, forming the eerie image that had tormented Sir Henry.\n",
            "\"Ah, I see,\" Dr. Halifax exclaimed, his eyes gleaming with understanding. \"The hallucination was not a ghostly apparition after all. It was a clever optical illusion created by this mirror and the lamp.\"\n",
            "Lady Studley's face relaxed, a look of relief washing over her. \"Thank you, Doctor,\" she said, her voice trembling with gratitude. \"We were afraid it might be something far more sinister.\"\n",
            "Dr. Halifax smiled reassuringly, his mind racing with the implications of his discovery. He realized that the strange occurrences at Studley Grange were not the work of a malevolent spirit but rather the result of a cleverly crafted optical illusion.\n",
            "As he left the Grange, Dr. Halifax couldn't shake off the feeling that something was still amiss, a sense that the mystery still lingered, waiting to be unraveled.\n",

            "The story provides a clear and concise setup, introducing the characters, setting, and central conflict. Dr. Halifax's investigation and revelation of the optical illusion create tension and suspense, which is further heightened by Lady Studley's relief and the implications of the discovery. However, there are still some gaps in the story, such as the reasons behind Sir Henry's illness and the identity of the person responsible for the optical illusion. These plot threads are only partially developed, leaving room for further development in the rest of the story.\n"

Story: It was a crisp autumn evening when Sherlock Holmes received a frantic visit from Percy Phelps, a young government clerk, who was in a state of utter distress. The naval treaty, a document of utmost importance, had been stolen from his possession, and he was on the brink of ruin. Holmes, ever the astute detective, listened intently as Percy recounted the events leading up to the theft.\n",
            "After gathering all the necessary details from Percy, Holmes delved into his investigation with fervor. He meticulously examined the scene of the crime, searching for any clues that could lead him to the perpetrator. His keen observation skills and sharp deductive reasoning were put to the test as he pieced together the puzzle of the stolen treaty.\n",
            "Days turned into nights as Holmes tirelessly pursued every lead, following a trail of breadcrumbs that eventually led him to Joseph Harrison, a former acquaintance of Percy's who had fallen on hard times.

From within the compartment, he retrieved the naval treaty, the very document that had caused Percy such distress. Holmes's heart raced as he realized the truth: Joseph had been the mastermind behind the theft, motivated by a combination of desperation and greed.\n",
            "With the treaty safely in hand, Holmes confronted Joseph, demanding an explanation for his actions. Joseph, realizing the futility of his scheme, confessed to the crime, revealing a complex web of deceit that had ensnared both Percy and himself.\n",

The theft of the naval treaty, the investigation conducted by Holmes, and the eventual discovery of the culprit are all major plot points that have been established. However, there are still some gaps in the narrative, such as the exact nature of Joseph's scheme and the consequences of his actions for the characters involved.\n"

Story: The rain poured down in sheets as Mr Carlyle hurried through the bustling streets of London, determined to find this mysterious expert Mr Baxter had mentioned – Wynn Carrados. The private detective’s mind raced with skepticism. How could a blind man help him solve the case of the ancient coin forgery? It seemed preposterous, but he was willing to entertain the idea, if only out of sheer curiosity.\n",
            "Arriving at the address Baxter had provided, Carlyle found himself standing before a modest yet elegant house in Richmond. Taking a deep breath, he rang the doorbell and was ushered inside by a courteous servant.\n",
            "Moments later, Carlyle found himself facing Wynn Carrados, a man of calm demeanor, seated in a study. The private detective couldn’t help but feel a twinge of doubt as he observed the blind man before him. How could he possibly assist in unraveling the complexities of the forgery scheme?\n",
            "Mr Carrados, however, seemed unperturbed by Carlyle’s skepticism. With a faint smile, he welcomed his guest and listened as Mr Carlyle recounted the reason for his visit – the mysterious ancient coin that may be a forgery.\n",
            "Challenged by Carlyle to prove his abilities, Carrados accepted the test with quiet confidence. He began to describe the private detective in intricate detail, from the slight crease in his left trouser leg to the faint scent of sandalwood that lingered around him. Mr Carlyle watched in astonishment as Carrados painted a vivid portrait of him without the aid of sight.\n",
            "Impressed and slightly unnerved, Mr Carlyle could no longer deny the extraordinary observational skills possessed by Wynn Carrados. He listened intently as Carrados unveiled the intricate web of deceit surrounding the forgery scheme, involving the cunning forger Pietro Stelli and his accomplice posing as a maid.\n",
            "With a keen mind and sharp instincts, Carrados guided Carlyle through the complex case, piecing together the puzzle with remarkable precision. As the investigation unfolded, Carlyle found himself in awe of the blind man’s uncanny abilities.\n",
            "With a final revelation, Carrados revealed the true culprit behind the forgery – none other than the enigmatic Baxter himself. The private detective was left stunned, realizing too late that he had been played by the cunning Mr Baxter.\n",
            "As Carlyle departed the house in disgrace, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that he had just witnessed something extraordinary – a demonstration of the power of observation and intuition, even in the absence of sight.\n",

            "This story has a clear plot with a central mystery or problem (the forgery scheme) and a main character (Mr Carlyle) who is trying to solve it. The story also introduces a key supporting character (Mr Carrados) who helps Mr Carlyle solve the mystery. However, there are still some gaps in the plot development. For example, the story doesn't provide much context for Mr Carlyle's case or the forgery scheme, and the reveal of the true culprit is somewhat abrupt. Additionally, the story could benefit from more tension and suspense as Mr Carlyle investigates the case. Overall, the plot development is estimated at 7/10 as there is potential for further development and refinement.\n"

Lord Torinouth's suspicions of foul play, particularly by Francis's own uncle, John Kempion, added a layer of intrigue to the case that Evelyn couldn't resist.\n",

The elderly lord's eyes held a mixture of worry and determination as he explained the situation to Evelyn. Francis Kempion had vanished without a trace, last seen walking along the beach near the estate. Lord Torinouth was convinced that John Kempion was behind the disappearance, driven by greed and ambition to claim the Kempion estates for himself.\n",

As she scoured the sandy shore for clues, her keen eyes caught sight of something glinting in the sunlight. Stooping down, she picked up a small Mexican coin, an incongruous item to find on the English beach. This discovery raised more questions than answers, but Evelyn knew she was onto something significant.\n",

            "Estimate how complete the following story is, in terms of plot development. Answer as a proportion. Story: It was a stormy night when Kennedy and Walter received a frantic phone call from Mrs. Amelia Fletcher, the wife of the late steel magnate John G. Fletcher. She informed them of her husband's sudden death and the disappearance of his will, which had been signed just days before his passing. Intrigued by the mysterious circumstances surrounding Fletcher's demise, Kennedy and Walter agreed to take on the case.\n",
            "Upon arriving at the Fletcher estate, they were greeted by a somber atmosphere and a sense of unease among the staff. Mrs. Fletcher, a dignified woman with a steely resolve, led them to the study where her husband had been found dead. Kennedy's keen eyes immediately noted the peculiar details of the room—the overturned chair, the open window, and the faint scent of almonds in the air.\n",
            "As they examined the scene, Walter discreetly questioned the staff and uncovered a possible motive for murder—a bitter family feud over the inheritance. John G. Fletcher's grandniece, Helen Bond, had been vocal about her dissatisfaction with her uncle's will, which left a considerable portion of his fortune to charity. Rumors abounded that Helen had been pressuring her uncle to change the will in her favor, ensuring her financial security and happiness with her fiancé, Professor Fletcher.\n",
            "Kennedy and Walter set out to interview Helen, a striking woman with a sharp wit and a calculating demeanor. She welcomed them into her elegant home, but her eyes betrayed a sense of unease as they questioned her about her relationship with her late uncle and her knowledge of the will. Despite her composed facade, Kennedy sensed a desperation in her that hinted at darker secrets lurking beneath the surface.\n",
            "As they delved deeper into the case, Kennedy and Walter uncovered a complex web of deceit and hidden motives. They discovered that John G. Fletcher's business partner, Mr. Edward Thompson, had been embezzling funds from the company for years, and that Helen's fiancé, Professor Fletcher, had been secretly collaborating with Thompson to secure his financial future.\n",
            "With the pieces of the puzzle falling into place, Kennedy and Walter realized that the murderer was not who they had initially suspected. The true culprit was none other than Helen Bond herself, who had killed her uncle to secure her inheritance and protect her own financial interests. The investigation had revealed a tangled web of greed, betrayal, and deception, and Kennedy and Walter had solved the case with their keen minds and sharp instincts.\n",
            "Based on the provided story, I would estimate that the plot development is around 70% complete. While some key elements of the mystery are revealed, such as the disappearance of the will and the bitter family feud, there are still many unanswered questions and unresolved plot threads. For example, the motive for Helen's actions is not fully explained, and the role of Professor Fletcher in the embezzlement scheme is still unclear. Additionally, the story has introduced several potential suspects and red herrings, leaving the reader with a sense of intrigue and anticipation for the next stage of the investigation.\n"

We found a trail of blood leading from her house to a nearby woods, but it disappeared into thin air.\" Polly's eyes widened as she took in the details. \"Intriguing,\" she murmured. \"What happened next?\" The man hesitated before continuing. \"We found a piece of fabric caught in a thorn bush, but when we pulled it free, it was covered in blood.

The locals whispered tales of his shady past and the chaos his hellish brew brought upon the community.\n",

The sunlight refracted through the clear liquid, casting a rainbow of colors across the room.\n",

As the weeks went by, Frances found herself growing stronger and more confident, her dependence on morphia slowly fading away.

            "As Cleek delved into the case, he discovered a web of deceit and betrayal woven by the Hon. Mrs. Brinkworth and her confederate, Colonel Murchison. The motive was clear - to eliminate Lord Stavornell and secure the inheritance for Mrs. Brinkworth's son. The plan was carefully orchestrated, with Mrs. Brinkworth taking on the role of the assassin disguised as the enigmatic \"little dark man.\" However, Cleek's keen mind had unraveled the mystery, and the true culprits were apprehended. The case was closed, and justice had been served.\n",
            "Based on the provided story, I would estimate that the plot development is approximately 60% complete. Here's why:\n",
            "1. The story introduces the main characters, Lord Stavornell, Mrs. Brinkworth, and Colonel Murchison, and their motives for the crime. This forms the basis of the plot, which is approximately 40% complete.\n",
            "2. The story provides some details about Cleek's investigation, including his use of deduction skills and keen observation. This adds depth to the plot, but the details are still limited, which brings the plot development to approximately 60% complete.\n",
            "3. The story reveals the motive behind the crime, but the details of the plan are still sketchy, leaving much of the plot unresolved. This means that the plot development is still incomplete, with approximately 40% of the story left to be told.\n",
            "4. The story concludes with the apprehension of the true culprits, but the resolution is still brief and lacks context. This leaves the plot feeling unfinished, with approximately 40% of the story still to be developed.\n",
            "Overall, while the story provides a good foundation for the plot, there is still much to be developed to make the story fully complete. Therefore, I would estimate that the plot development is approximately 60% complete.\n",

Story: It was a crisp autumn evening when Sherlock Holmes received a frantic visit from Percy Phelps, a young government clerk, who was in a state of utter distress. The naval treaty, a document of utmost importance, had been stolen from his possession, and he was on the brink of ruin. Holmes, ever the astute detective, listened intently as Percy recounted the events leading up to the theft.\n",
            "After gathering all the necessary details from Percy, Holmes delved into his investigation with fervor. He meticulously examined the scene of the crime, searching for any clues that could lead him to the perpetrator. His keen observation skills and sharp deductive reasoning were put to the test as he pieced together the puzzle of the stolen treaty.\n",
            "Days turned into nights as Holmes tirelessly pursued every lead, following a trail of breadcrumbs that eventually led him to Joseph Harrison, a former acquaintance of Percy's who had fallen on hard times. Suspicions began to swirl around Joseph, whose sudden acquisition of wealth raised eyebrows in the close-knit community.\n",

As the moon hung high in the sky, Holmes hid in the shadows, patiently waiting for any sign of suspicious activity. The hours crept by slowly, but just as Holmes was beginning to feel the weight of fatigue, movement stirred in the darkness.\n",

From within the compartment, he retrieved the naval treaty, the very document that had caused Percy such distress. Holmes's heart raced as he realized the truth: Joseph had been the mastermind behind the theft, motivated by a combination of desperation and greed.\n",
            "With the treaty safely in hand, Holmes confronted Joseph, demanding an explanation for his actions. Joseph, realizing the futility of his scheme, confessed to the crime, revealing a complex web of deceit that had ensnared both Percy and himself.\n",

While there are still some unanswered questions, such as the motivations behind Joseph's actions, the majority of the key events have been established. The theft of the naval treaty, the investigation conducted by Holmes, and the eventual discovery of the culprit are all major plot points that have been established.

Story: It was a crisp autumn morning when Martin Hewitt received a peculiar request from a local constable to assist in a case involving illicit distilling. The small town of Oakwood had been abuzz with rumors of a secret operation producing illegal spirits, and the constabulary had finally managed to uncover the location of the distilling ring. Hewitt, intrigued by the challenge, set out to investigate the matter further.\n",

The nursery, located at the outskirts of town, appeared innocent enough on the surface, but Hewitt sensed there was more to it than met the eye. With his trusty assistant by his side, they began a thorough examination of the nursery, carefully inspecting each corner and crevice for any clues that might lead them to the heart of the operation.\n",

Without hesitation, they opened the trapdoor and descended into a dark, damp cellar below. What they found was beyond their wildest expectations—a fully functioning distillery, complete with copper stills, barrels of fermenting mash, and shelves lined with bottles of illicit spirits.\n",

Determined and resolute, he agreed to take on the case and set out to unravel the mystery behind the explosive attacks.\\nIntrigued by the challenge that lay ahead, Mr. Beck delved into the background of Joshua Marable, a wealthy and influential shipping magnate with a fleet of vessels that traversed the seas with valuable cargo. Suspicions began to form in Mr. Beck's mind as he learned more about Marable's business dealings and personal life.\\nTo gather more information, Mr. Beck decided to join a voyage to Hong Kong on Marable's flagship vessel, The Queen. Disguised as a passenger, he kept a close watch on Marable and the crew, searching for any clues that could lead him to the culprit behind the sabotage.\\nDuring the voyage, Mr. Beck noticed something peculiar about Marable\\u2014he always carried two identical black bags wherever he went. One bag seemed to be for show, while the other remained securely by his side at all times.

But all that changed one fateful day when the news of the heinous crime spread like wildfire through the community. Pretty and beloved Mrs. Vincent, known for her kindness and grace, had been found stabbed to the heart in her own study.\\nThe town was in shock, unable to comprehend such a brutal act in their midst. With no clear motive or suspects in sight, the case fell into the hands of Detective Thomas Reed, a seasoned investigator known for his keen intuition and sharp mind.\\nAs Detective Reed delved into the investigation, he quickly realized that the quiet facade of Brixton hid a world of secrets and lies. Mrs. Vincent's husband, the young and charming Mr. Vincent, appeared grief-stricken and devastated by his wife's tragic death. But as Reed dug deeper, he began to uncover inconsistencies in Mr. Vincent's alibi and behavior.\\nOne clue led to another, and soon Reed stumbled upon a mysterious green-stone idol hidden in the Vincent household. The idol, with its strange carvings and eerie aura, seemed out of place in the elegant home of the Vincents. Reed knew he had stumbled upon a significant piece of the puzzle, but its true significance eluded him for the time being.\\nMeanwhile, a determined woman named Evelyn approached Detective Reed, claiming to have vital information about the case. Evelyn revealed that she was seeking justice for her lover, who had been involved in a romantic entanglement with Mrs. Vincent. She painted a picture of a love triangle gone wrong, of jealousy and betrayal that ultimately led to Mrs. Vincent's untimely demise.\\nAs Reed pieced together the information provided by Evelyn and the evidence he had gathered, a chilling realization dawned on him. Mr. Vincent's carefully constructed alibi began to crumble, revealing a sinister plot to rid himself of his wife and his romantic rival. The green-stone idol, a symbol of greed and deception, played a crucial role in the unfolding drama.\\nIn a stunning turn of events, the real murderer was unmasked, and justice was served. The revelation sent shockwaves through Brixton, as the townspeople grappled with the truth behind Mrs. Vincent's tragic death. Chance had played a significant role in the unraveling of the case, proving that in the game of detective work, sometimes fate had a hand in bringing the guilty to justice.\\nAs the sun set on the once peaceful town of Brixton, Detective Reed reflected on the twists and turns of the investigation. The case of Mrs. Vincent's murder had been solved, but the scars left behind would linger for a long time to come. And in the quiet streets of Brixton, the shadows of deceit and betrayal served as a stark reminder that darkness could lurk behind even the most beautiful facades.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reveal_sentence\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 101,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Through a combination of clever deductions and scientific analyses, they pieced together the events leading up to John G.

However, there are some gaps in the plot development that prevent it from being fully complete. Here are some areas where the story could benefit from more development:\\n1. Characterization: While we get a sense of the main characters, Mrs. Vincent, Mr. Vincent, and Detective Reed, they could benefit from more depth and complexity. Their motivations, backstory, and personalities could be fleshed out to make them more relatable and engaging.\\n2. Suspects and motives: While there are some inconsistencies in Mr. Vincent's alibi, the story could benefit from more suspects and motives to keep the reader guessing. Adding more red herrings and twists to the investigation would keep the reader engaged and invested in the story.\\n3. Emotional impact: While the story touches on the emotional impact of the crime on the townspeople, it could benefit from more exploration of the emotional toll on the characters and the community. The investigation could also delve deeper into the psychological effects of the crime on the perpetrator and the victims' loved ones.\\n4. Resolution: While the story resolves the crime in the end, there could be more buildup to the final reveal. The investigation could be more intense and suspenseful, with more obstacles and challenges for Detective Reed to overcome before uncovering the truth.\\nOverall, the story has a good foundation, but it could benefit from more development in these areas to create a more complete and engaging plot.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pred\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.2675072683383788,\n        \"min\": -1.0,\n        \"max\": 0.8,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.09999999999999998,\n          0.4,\n          0.33999999999999997\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
