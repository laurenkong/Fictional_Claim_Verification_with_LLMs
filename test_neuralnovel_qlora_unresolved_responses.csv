Story: In the secluded mountains behind Virginia, nestled in the mist-shrouded valleys where the trees whispered ancient secrets and the wind carried a haunting melody, there stood the stone house of Doomdorf. A man of dark repute, Doomdorf was known for his illicit liquor that held a devilish allure to those who dared to taste it. The locals whispered tales of his shady past and the chaos his hellish brew brought upon the community.
Uncle Abner, a wise and respected elder of the area, and Squire Randolph, a man of authority and influence, grew concerned about the impacts of Doomdorf's activities on the community. Together, they decided to confront the mysterious man and put an end to his nefarious deeds once and for all.
One fateful evening, they made their way to Doomdorf's stone house, determined to face him and demand an end to his brewing. But as they approached, they were met with an eerie silence that seemed to wrap the house in a shroud of foreboding.
Upon breaking into Doomdorf's locked room, Uncle Abner and Squire Randolph were met with a sight that chilled them to the bone—Doomdorf lay dead on the floor, a bullet wound in his chest. The room was in disarray, with bottles of his infamous liquor scattered around, casting an ominous glow in the dim light.
As they grappled with the shock of Doomdorf's death, a series of confessions began to emerge from unlikely sources within the community. Each person claimed responsibility for the murder in their own bizarre and twisted ways, weaving a web of lies and deceit that only served to deepen the mystery surrounding Doomdorf's demise.
Amidst the chaos and confusion, Uncle Abner and Squire Randolph sought to uncover the truth behind Doomdorf's death. Each confession led them down a twisted path of secrets and lies, where the line between reality and illusion blurred in the shadows of the mountains.
It was during a moment of quiet contemplation, as they sat in Doomdorf's room surrounded by the echoes of his dark past, that a beam of sunlight pierced through the window, illuminating a water bottle on the floor. The sunlight refracted through the clear liquid, casting a rainbow of colors across the room.
In that moment of clarity, Uncle Abner's sharp eyes caught sight of something glinting within the water bottle—a reflection of a loaded gun that had been hidden in plain sight. With a sudden realization, Uncle Abner understood the truth behind Doomdorf's death.

Kennedy meticulously examined every inch of the room, searching for clues that would lead him to the truth. It was clear to him that Cushing's death was no accident - there was foul play at hand.
As Kennedy delved deeper into the investigation, he discovered a complex web of deceit, jealousy, and greed among the town's prominent figures. It seemed that Cushing had been on the brink of a groundbreaking invention in synthetic rubber, a discovery that could revolutionize the rubber industry and bring immense wealth to whoever held the key to it.
Suspicions fell on several individuals, each with their own motives for wanting Cushing out of the picture. There was Dr. Harris, a respected physician in town who had shown a keen interest in Cushing's work. There was also Thomas Reed, the ambitious owner of the local rubber mill, who stood to gain the most from Cushing's invention.
Through a series of clever deductions and scientific experiments, Kennedy pieced together the puzzle that would lead him to the true culprit. [/INST] 0.4285714285714286  # Answer only as a proportion, with no other details."

Little did she know that this bracelet held the key to a hidden treasure that had been buried on the Harding estate for decades.
One stormy night, as the wind howled outside and rain lashed against the windows, Miss Harding was startled awake by the sound of breaking glass. Heart pounding, she crept downstairs to investigate, only to come face to face with a masked woman who demanded the treasured bracelet.
Terrified but determined, Miss Harding refused to hand over the heirloom. The masked woman's eyes glittered with malice as she lunged forward, but before she could grab the bracelet, a voice cut through the darkness.

Sitting in his opulent office, with its mahogany desk and walls adorned with framed stock certificates, Grayson fumed as he recounted the recent string of financial losses that had plagued his firm.
Summoning all his resolve, Grayson picked up the telephone and dialed a number he had never thought he would need to call—the office of Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, the enigmatic genius known far and wide as The Thinking Machine.
Within hours, the professor arrived at Grayson's office, his keen blue eyes taking in every detail with razor-sharp focus. Grayson wasted no time in outlining the problem that had brought him to seek the help of the brilliant scientist.

The Thinking Machine listened intently, his mind already whirring with possibilities. He requested to speak with Miss Winthrop and observe her at work. Grayson readily agreed, eager to uncover the source of the leak that threatened his financial empire.
As The Thinking Machine observed Miss Winthrop transcribing dictation, his sharp eyes caught the subtle movements of her fingers on the typewriter keys. He noticed the precise rhythm with which she typed, the slight pauses between certain letters, and the way she glanced at the telephone on her desk every so often.

One crisp autumn morning, Hazell found himself in the quaint town of Leamington, camera slung over his shoulder and a new book tucked under his arm. Little did he know that this ordinary day would soon lead him into the heart of a daring railway mystery that would test his investigative prowess like never before.
It all began when Hazell overheard a conversation at the local railway station about a missing goods truck that was supposed to be carrying valuable paintings from Leamington to Winchester for an upcoming exhibition.

She was in a state of shock and fear, her eyes pleading for help as she recounted the strange events that had unfolded in her life. Her husband, Hilton Cubitt, had been shot dead in their home, and she herself had narrowly escaped an attempt on her life. The only clue left behind by the perpetrator was a series of dancing men drawn in chalk on the walls of their estate.

As they delved deeper into the case, Holmes discovered a complex web of deceit and betrayal that led to the tragic deaths of Hilton Cubitt and Elsie Cubitt. The dancing men were not just random doodles, but a carefully crafted message that pointed to a dark and sinister plot.
Through his meticulous analysis and deduction skills, Holmes pieced together the puzzle and uncovered the identity of the perpetrator. It was revealed that the murderer was none other than Elsie Cubitt herself, driven to madness by her husband's infidelity and betrayal.

""It is a curious thing, Watson,"" Holmes said thoughtfully, ""how the mind can be driven to such extremes by the slightest of provocations.

""Come in,"" Kennedy called, setting the manuscript aside.
The door swung open, revealing J. Perry Spencer, a wealthy financier known for his extensive art collection. His usually composed demeanor was marred by worry lines etched into his brow.

However, as he approached the grand manor house, a sense of unease began to settle in the pit of his stomach.

Story: Belmore Park was abuzz with excitement as aviator Charles Norton prepared for his groundbreaking flight in his gyroscope-equipped machine. The park was packed with spectators eager to witness the historic event. Among the crowd was Kennedy, a seasoned investigator known for his keen eye and sharp intuition.
Kennedy had been called in to look into a series of mysterious aeroplane accidents that had been plaguing Belmore Park.

My dear friend Harry Carstone and I had ventured to this remote Mexican town in search of adventure, unaware of the dark and malevolent forces that awaited us.
Our fateful encounter with Lola Tepeaca, a striking woman with an air of mystery about her, marked the beginning of our descent into a world of deception and danger. Lola was the owner of a peculiar artifact—an intricately carved turquoise skull—that seemed to hold a sinister power over those who encountered it. Little did we know that this skull would become the centerpiece of a twisted and deadly game orchestrated by Lola herself.
As days turned into weeks, Harry became increasingly fascinated by the turquoise skull, unable to resist its allure despite my warnings of impending danger. It was on a stormy night, with lightning illuminating the sky in eerie flashes, that tragedy struck. Harry, drawn by an irresistible force, touched the skull, triggering its deadly mechanisms. In a heartbeat, he became the thirteenth victim of the skull, succumbing to its malevolent power.

The old farmhouse stood as a dark silhouette against the stormy sky, its windows boarded up and its doors creaking in the gusts of wind. Many in the nearby town of Berwick whispered about the mysterious disappearance of its new resident, David Robb, a retired businessman with a tarnished reputation.
Samuel Behrens, the brother of Robb's missing former business partner, had arrived in Berwick determined to uncover the truth behind his brother's vanishing.

Miss Myrl, a woman of sharp wit and keen intellect, leaned forward attentively. ""Pray, do tell, Doctor. I am all ears.""
Dr. Stewart proceeded to recount the curious case of Major-General Sir Anthony Collingswood's missing diamond, a priceless gem gifted to him by the Rajah of Ringanpore. The diamond had been in the Collingswood family for generations, a symbol of honor and prestige. However, during the sale of the diamond at a reputable jewelry merchant's office, it was discovered that the precious gem had been switched with a smaller, inferior stone.
""Goodness gracious, what a scandal!"" exclaimed Miss Myrl, her eyes widening in astonishment. ""And what became of Major-General Collingswood's nephew, Alan?""

His eccentric dining habits, along with his keen observation skills, had earned him a reputation as a detective like no other. As he delicately peeled the egg, a distressed young lady approached his table.
""Mr. Hazell, I am in dire need of your assistance,"" the young lady, Miss St. John Mallaby, said with a quiver in her voice.
Hazell looked up from his egg, his piercing blue eyes meeting hers. ""Please, have a seat and tell me what troubles you, Miss Mallaby.""
The young lady took a seat across from him and began to explain her predicament. She had been traveling on a train from London to Edinburgh when she realized that her aunt's precious diamond necklace, a family heirloom, was missing. She suspected that it had been stolen during the journey and had a strong suspicion that the culprit was a fellow passenger, the Honourable George Kestron.
Hazell listened intently, his mind already racing with possibilities. He assured Miss Mallaby that he would do everything in his power to recover the stolen necklace and bring the thief to justice. With a nod of gratitude, Miss Mallaby left Hazell to his meal, knowing that she had entrusted her case to the best possible detective.

He spoke to other passengers, observed their behaviors, and pieced together a timeline of events leading up to the disappearance of the necklace.
As the train rattled on towards Edinburgh, Hazell's suspicions began to solidify around the Honourable George Kestron. The man's nervous glances and fidgety demeanor did not escape Hazell's watchful eye. However, he knew he needed concrete evidence to confront Kestron.
With a twinkle in his eye and a plan forming in his mind, Hazell made his way to the first-class carriage where Kestron and his valet, Jameson, were seated. He engaged Kestron in conversation, subtly probing for information while carefully observing his reactions. As the train approached its final destination, Hazell made his move.
In a bold and calculated bluff, Hazell accused Kestron of being involved in the theft of the diamond necklace. The Honourable George Kestron's face paled, but he vehemently denied any wrongdoing. It was then that Hazell turned his attention to Jameson, Kestron's valet, who had been standing quietly in the corner of the carriage.

It seemed preposterous, but he was willing to entertain the idea, if only out of sheer curiosity.
Arriving at the address Baxter had provided, Carlyle found himself standing before a modest yet elegant house in Richmond. Taking a deep breath, he rang the doorbell and was ushered inside by a courteous servant.

Mr Carrados, however, seemed unperturbed by Carlyle’s skepticism. With a faint smile, he welcomed his guest and listened as Mr Carlyle recounted the reason for his visit – the mysterious ancient coin that may be a forgery.
Challenged by Carlyle to prove his abilities, Carrados accepted the test with quiet confidence.

Story: Detective Evelyn Summers received the summons from Lord Torinouth with a mix of trepidation and excitement. The disappearance of Francis Kempion, the heir to the Kempion estates, was a mystery that had piqued the interest of the entire county. Lord Torinouth's suspicions of foul play, particularly by Francis's own uncle, John Kempion, added a layer of intrigue to the case that Evelyn couldn't resist.
Arriving at the grand Kempion estate, Evelyn was greeted by a sense of foreboding as she was led to the study where Lord Torinouth awaited. The elderly lord's eyes held a mixture of worry and determination as he explained the situation to Evelyn. Francis Kempion had vanished without a trace, last seen walking along the beach near the estate. Lord Torinouth was convinced that John Kempion was behind the disappearance, driven by greed and ambition to claim the Kempion estates for himself.
Armed with this information, Evelyn set out to investigate the disappearance of Francis Kempion. She began by visiting the beach where Francis was last seen. As she scoured the sandy shore for clues, her keen eyes caught sight of something glinting in the sunlight. Stooping down, she picked up a small Mexican coin, an incongruous item to find on the English beach. This discovery raised more questions than answers, but Evelyn knew she was onto something significant.
Her investigation led her to John Kempion's residence, where she found herself face to face with the enigmatic La Senora, John's Spanish wife.

It was revealed that La Senora had plotted with her brother to stage Francis's abduction, framing John Kempion in the process. Their ultimate goal was to secure the Kempion estates for themselves, with La Senora at the helm. [/INST] 0.4285714285714286  # Answer only as a proportion, in the form of a decimal.

Each claimed to be the hero of the tale they were about to tell—the story of the turquoise skull.

Among the crowd stood Kennedy, a brilliant inventor and detective, who was there not just as a spectator but as a keen observer, ready to unravel the mystery behind the recent aeroplane accidents that had plagued the park.
Kennedy had been called in by Norton himself, who suspected foul play in the series of unexplained crashes that had cast a shadow over his innovative creations. With the assistance of the Pinkertons, Kennedy had been meticulously investigating the incidents, piecing together clues and following leads that had ultimately led him to a surprising revelation.
As the demonstration began, Norton's gyroscope machines whirred to life, lifting the aeroplanes into the sky with precision and grace. The crowd watched in awe as the aircraft soared through the air, performing intricate maneuvers that showcased the capabilities of Norton's invention.

Hewitt, intrigued by the challenge, set out to investigate the matter further.
Upon arrival at the site of the distillery, Hewitt's sharp eyes immediately noted the subtle signs of clandestine activity.

With his trusty assistant by his side, they began a thorough examination of the nursery, carefully inspecting each corner and crevice for any clues that might lead them to the heart of the operation.
After hours of meticulous searching, Hewitt's assistant stumbled upon a hidden trapdoor beneath a rug in the greenhouse. Without hesitation, they opened the trapdoor and descended into a dark, damp cellar below. What they found was beyond their wildest expectations—a fully functioning distillery, complete with copper stills, barrels of fermenting mash, and shelves lined with bottles of illicit spirits.
As they explored the cellar, Hewitt's keen observations revealed the intricacies of the operation.
